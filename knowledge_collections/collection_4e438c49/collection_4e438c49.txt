zoho crm canvas is here to revolutionize the way that you view and work with your crm data canvas lets you reposition elements and rebuild the structure of zoho crm details page by keeping the foundations intact yet personalizing it to your comfort and convenience in this video we will help you understand the experience that canvas brings to your crm by making a detailed comparison of it with the default crm design and answering some of the common questions that you may have about the feature such as what does canvas actually bring to the table how exactly does canvas improve the crm user experience and what are some primary benefits offered by canvas that the default design doesn't first let's take a look at how a record appears in crm as soon as you add it now your crm data is something that constantly evolves as your organization expands imagine your sales reps trying to find relevant information but due to the vast amount of customer related data that is constantly added to your crm they find it tedious to navigate through the system this is because by default records in crm usually have a standard view this means they are usually presented in multiple sections of a two-column layout however as your organizational and crm needs evolve the design should too with canvas your crm is far more flexible and essentially lets you personalize according to your organizational needs this makes it convenient for your team to filter out relevant information on your crm page at a glance for instance when your sales representatives interact with your customers they can maneuver through the new design optimized crm page sans the lengthy scrolls of data that they otherwise would have to browse through during the call canvas lets you organize your data components in a manner that fits your specific business processes thereby increasing productivity by reducing design limitations the canvas builder in w-y-s-i-w-y-g editor what you see is what you get editor that takes things up a notch by allowing you to design your pages exactly the way you want with canvas you can arrange data in a way that meets your sales team's needs and makes it easier for them to use crm for their daily work it packs several exciting benefits such as extensive customization branding flexibility and data organization and more when compared with the default crm design let's take a look at these factors in detail first flexibility in data organization by default the crm record detail page has a linear structure where data is arranged in a sequential manner so to view a specific detail amidst all of this one needs to scroll down to find the relevant data on the contrary canvas lets you create a design framework depending on exactly how you want your data to appear it lets you build creative pages in a non-linear manner where you get to organize the data elements in any hierarchy you want this minimizes time and effort taken in browsing through large chunks of data as all of the key information pertaining to a record is available right on the top fold and the user can infer the required details at glance for example a real estate agency may choose to place a customer's property details right on the top fold so that an agent does not have to search and scan as soon as they land on a customer record or in the case of a travel agency the trip summary including destination date of travel list of documents and other details as seen fit could be placed right on the top left corner of the page this way an agent can take away key details at a quick glance canvas gives you the complete power to recreate the crm page in such a way that it's aligned with your organization's needs and the brand aesthetic however with great power comes great responsibility not only can you reorganize data you also get to choose which component appears on your page and which doesn't only the fields subforms links and other components that you drag and drop into the editor will appear on the page so make sure that you add all of the key details and that you haven't left any fields out then reorganize these details as deemed fit second creative designs and custom backgrounds the record detail page in crm by default comes with a plain white background which is not customizable using canvas you can fuse your brand colors and enhance the detail page design custom backgrounds with solid colors and eye-catching gradients to give a massive visual impact this grabs the attention of users where they will be able to relate the page's context easily third illustrations and highlights for better context making information look presentable is an art and with canvas you can indulge your artistic inclination with innumerable styling options available for you you can add images illustrations icons and also highlight texts as you design a layout this holds the user's attention breaks away from the monotony and helps you quickly draw inferences from the designed page for example you can highlight the crucial data of statistics dates amounts and the like in different colors indicating its importance besides this you can make it contextually sound with relevant illustrations or images for example you can add relevant images such as a location icon next to the address section for better visual appeal or add a beats per minute icon displaying the resting heart rate for adults in a page designed to capture patient details fourth 360 degree view of customer data consider the contacts module where you typically see all of the primary details of the customer here along with the key fields such as phone email and basic preferences you can also display the stage history of the associated deal the deal amount type closing date and other relevant details this complete picture helps your sales reps to understand a customer's journey right away and subsequently have a more informed conversation as they connect with customers so canvas lets you bring a related list component to the record details page and offers extensive customization possibilities for the same so that you are offered a complete 360 degree view of a particular record this is in contrast to the standard view in which customization capability of a related list was limited to just adding required columns in an otherwise rigid table fifth curated actions as per organization needs actions for crm records are clickable buttons that let you initiate a process for example a send email button here to send an email to the lead or the clone button to make a copy of the record instead of creating one from scratch the default layout in crm has a list of action buttons which cannot be removed or edited even if you do not use most of these buttons they remain on the page whereas canvas gives you the leverage to choose only the action buttons that are likely to be used this clears up the clutter and gives those action buttons more visibility six conditional styling and visibility for a rich user experience logically designing the page can create emphasis on crucial data with canvas you can dictate how data should be presented based on specific conditions let's look at an example if a case status is set as critical the entire case details section could have a red background and when set as normal it can turn to orange thus visually emphasizing the priority of the record this way you can set visual cues and color code data to suit your business processes and accelerate further actions on those records this is called conditional styling and with this setting you can alter the text styles borders alignment and more to achieve a preferred look in another scenario your deal stages can be highlighted in different colors in order to draw focus to important stages closed one could be displayed as green closed gloss in red and so forth and so on other examples include discounts and deal amounts when discount is greater than 12 display the field in red if deal amount is greater than 50 000 display the amount in green if there's an empty field in a section highlight the section tab in red and so on you can also show or hide relevant components based on specific conditions for instance you can program crm to show email related lists only when the email field is filled if it's empty the email related list remains hidden this way you will keep the details page supremely relevant and contextual and clutter free well that's a wrap to summarize while the default details page design still fits the bill for most organizations when it comes to specific business contexts it's quite a hassle to work with it you could be drowning in data and with no context to your page getting lost as you work your way through multiple sections fields and records to find what you need so if you are looking for a toolset to set up your crm page with flexible design that lets you decide the placement of crm components as per need and requirement alter everything from the background image to the colors and modify the entire structure of the page then start exploring the infinite possibilities that canvas has to offer right away

hello everyone welcome to this video on getting started with the canvas builder in this video you will learn what the possibilities of canvas are and what are the key components in building your own canvas layout so with no further ado let's dive right into the demo canvas is a user interface management tool that is built right into the crm system right now and for the record canvas is applicable for any business from any domain or size regardless of you know whether they are from insurance you know product sale or real estate regardless of the vertical and regardless of the size of the company canvas is going to help an organization all right that said for the purpose of this demonstration uh i have picked the example of a real estate company okay so let's assume that a real estate company called zilker realtors they are using zoho crm to track their property management activities and their crm would look something like this you know they have their set of enquiries deals uh properties details and builders and so on so as you may already know uh you know when you go into one particular record currently the detail view the record detail view is designed like this so you have the primary details of the contact and then we have a bunch of related lists which is nothing but data from associated modules in crm okay so uh now there is nothing essentially wrong with this view you know it is completely functional uh whatever details you require you can find it from this page it's all in here but when you put a magnifying glass and you know see whether this detail page this standard design with specific needs of organizations then you know you realize that it may not really fit a bill for instance let's say in this particular customer's case i want to find out who the builder associated to this property is so this customer is interested in say i have to scroll down and come to the properties section and here i can see that you know what property is associated if i need to find who the builder is you know i need to navigate to other places so what i'm talking about is the out of the box setup of course we can have widgets to further customize it but out of the box uh you know what you know whatever is easy uh is what we are talking about so here you have to navigate to further uh records of further modules in the system and here uh you know i have the builder detail if i need to know further details about the builders i need to jump to the builders module and so on so this involves a lot of clicks um so while the detail page is informative enough uh when it comes down to specific needs you know still we gotta run around in circles and that is what we are you know trying to solve with canvas so basically the primary challenges of the default design can be summarized as conventional design as in you know you have a two column layout and related lists arranged one after the other with limited customization possibilities so that is your poor conventional design and uh you know another challenge is data organization is not it doesn't fit the bill in you know all cases so now let me switch to what we call the canvas view here we go so i understand that a lot of you a lot of you might have already used canvas uh for those of you who have already used this this will serve as a refresher of sorts and for those that are completely new to canvas you know this is a good place to get started so this is how the canvas view looks like so this is the same set of details that we saw in the standard view reorganized to uh you know fit the requirements of that particular real estate agent or that department right so here we have the same um you know contact details organized in a different way we have the basic details on the left and you as you can see the sections are neatly compartmentalized so that it's easy for the agent to take away what is important for their processes all right so for instance you see the builder information right here okay i don't have to go anywhere else in the system and you know we have used colors well in order to draw focus to key fields and then other further details are arranged in the form of switchable tabs and you know you don't have to really scroll down anywhere this saves real estate on the page and whatever you need is readily available all right so now our primary challenges we spoke about that is conventional design that has been addressed as you can see you know canvas lets you design the page the way you want offers bespoke design this way you can carry across your brand uh colors and you know color schemes across you know the crm platform so your website and your crm could now reflect the same design schemes right so that we have addressed the factor of bespoke design and of course uh more importantly we have sorted data organization so which is you know now data is very relevant it's organized in a way that is very relevant to the person working with this page all right so that is that has been addressed now not just this canvas offers an additional layer of customization right for instance this real estate agent is not the only person working on this record right perhaps zilker realtors has multiple teams working on this particular deal you know to converge various other you know objectives converge on other objectives for instance the marketing team might be interested to know more about how we got this customer into the system in the first place you know they might be more interested in looking at the social media scene and you know the legal team might be interested in looking through the contracts so there are various aspects of this particular deal that different teams are interested in but so far all of them have been working with a single standard view so canvas will break all that with canvas you can create profile based canvas views that is you can create multiple views that cater to the you know objectives of different teams in the organization for instance let me now switch to the marketing canvas view there you go now for the same customer this is what the marketing team will look at they will look at you know similarly you see the contact details on the left you see a little difference in the design and you can see that the enquiry sources were male so now this person you know whoever is working in the marketing team they'll immediately take away the inquiry source what campaign brought this customer in what is the social media scene like so all of these factors are what are more important to this you know marketing team and that is readily available for them when they land on this page and of course the for you know other further details are indeed present on the page but now what is relevant to them is given top priority so you have emails attachments all other details organized the way you want similarly you could create a canvas view for the legal team and prioritize the attachments and deal details and so on so this way canvas allows you to create you know role based uh customization is possible so not just this the you know canvas also offers unified crm experience uh across your audiences so now we have looked at the detail page this is of course for your immediate users employees and you can extend this experience to your customers as well that is uh let's say zilker has enabled self service portal uh for their customers and when this customer logs into their client portal you know they will see this canvas view so whatever is visible whatever has been made visible according to the personal settings those fields will be uh you know arranged in the canvas layout so this this way your canvas experience is extended across platforms across audiences whether it is your internal employees or customers and partners um all right so these are the key factors of canvas and now there is an interesting um you know factor here now let's say i go into this record this is a canvas view as you can see there is a property deal section and we have highlighted this stage in yellow let me navigate to the next record in this module now you see that the deal is highlighted i mean the stage is highlighted in green next you know it's highlighted in a different color and for this record you quickly see that the client preferences header glows red right so now what this means is that canvas allows you to have visual cues that mean different things to the users you know working on this page so we have written a rule that says if there is an empty field in this section let the corresponding header glow red right so now you see property type interested in value is missing so we have this client preferences title glowing red which is not the case with the previous record so canvas can offer a very dynamic experience for every record it you can make uh you know the design very contextual and meaningful with the help of this feature called conditional styling and visibility so based on a certain condition you can change the styling and based on a certain condition you can also dictate the visibility of a component for instance you can say that if the email is empty then hide the email related list because it's not relevant right without an email you will probably not have this related list may not uh make sense so like this you can also show or hide components based on certain conditions this is called conditional styling and disability right so these are all very powerful and interesting features that canvas offers which can go a long way in personalizing your layout for every role in your company all right so that said let's dive right into the product let's try into the builder to see how this is actually done okay so as uh akilan and weber pointed out canvas is built right into the system you can go in to customization and canvas builder that's where you will design your layout create like a detailed page so let's try and create the same thing for the clients module okay right so canvas comes with a set of pre-designed templates you can either you know start from a template where 50 of the job is already done for you uh you can go with the same you know themes all you need to do there is just map a few fields and modify a certain design aspects if it doesn't fit your needs and then you're ready to go so for this demo i'll go to a blank template and show how this is done from scratch okay so the moment you land on the builder there are three important points to note elements data and style elements is how you package data in for instance we have bunch of elements including you know section tabs tables and so on section is uh you know most frequently used element which you saw on the pages right that's it you decide how the data is going to be packed right next you you know start including data in so what goes into this section is the next item you know you can simply drag and drop all these pieces of fields right there you go okay so once you have your set of fields now you see these are all kind of misaligned so all you need to do is click outside drag across these elements and align them with so these are all handy tools quick tools to you know take care of these little details right now there are further elements you know like text i can give this uh a header you know let me position this better right now comes the text right so text can be used in order to create headings or you know little notes for your users like points to remember for instance customer overview okay right because there's my text element there are other elements such as tabs and tables which is again a way for you to package data you know you drag and drop a tab and simply select what item should come on that particular tab right so this saves space on the page so that is your tabs and then you have table which is again a way for you to package data simply drag and drop the table and start inserting fields it will appear uh you know in the form of rows and it's aligned well that's it that's your table we saw about text and then you have a bunch of interesting icons now this is a way for you to visually represent data so i can simply drag and drop an icon representing this customer overview this is a business card icon now which works like this right so this way there are multiple icons here to represent twitter linkedin uh you know restaurant there is a 4k spoon icon there lot of interesting icons when you you know browse through them you can you know drag and drop whichever icon is relevant for your needs so there we go and then there is line which is which works like a separator of sorts you can make it vertical or horizontal that's about it right these are all elements which are you know uh which allow you to neatly organize your data set okay so now here uh we've used these elements now we have looked at elements and we've added a few uh fields here that is data in the next thing is style for every data component you have ample styling options now let me you know style this let's say you choose a background color whatever color you like and you know maybe we can also change the font uh yeah and then you have all the formatting options you could uh you know including the size color and so on okay something like this okay uh that way now the styles also includes you know borders shadow padding radius so many other styling options are there so you can spend some time on looking at what the options are and apply those styling options to the page this is fundamentally how the builder works you choose a suitable element you start adding data in and you style every data component okay now when you come when you when it gets to data there are three sub categories of data one is your primary fields then you have your related lists and action buttons okay so related is nothing but what we saw associated uh data for instance i drag and drop properties this is an uh this is a related list right now when it comes to related lists you have you know multiple customization options you can bring in various fields from the related list and make it appear on the main contacts module so here i'm going into data so now you see so far when you click on the you know main builder you see contact based fields which is the primary module the moment you click inside this related list component then go to data you now get all the property related fields here right so land area uh you know floor plan whatever i need i can add property owner and so on okay listing status right so this is how you customize a related list drag and drop a related list component click inside the component go back to data and you have all the related list based fields showing up you can drag and drop those and style them the way you want all right let me just quickly add another related list let's say i'm going to add property deals okay there you go now apart from these fields if i want additional deal based fields click inside deals go back to data and start adding them for instance i had type uh you know closing date and so on so you can position them wherever you want and style them okay that's how this works and apart from this in data apart from primary fields related lists you have action buttons action buttons are nothing but uh you know you know the pre-designed uh buttons that are available in standard view what happens is a lot of people may not really use all the buttons right maybe they don't use portal invitation they don't use print preview so why have them on the page if you don't use them right so canvas offers you the flexibility to have the action buttons that are only relevant for that particular page or process right so here i've just compartmentalized this with a line i'm going to just add action buttons over here right it'll clone find and merge duplicates so if you want only these three buttons to show up over here uh and the rest may be hidden inside or you know you can just have the more likely so these are all the options for the buttons and you can also style the buttons but it's you know in the normal view or hover mode uh so let me just quickly maybe give a background see once you are finished with styling the button you don't have to style every button from scratch manually just copy style and paste style there you go that's about it okay it's quite easy there's a lot of handy tools like this now we have looked at all the three data elements whether it is uh you know primary module based fields related lists or action buttons this is how you uh get this going so you know you can decide what fields are required for which profiles and then pack you know put the packaging element and then start adding data style them that's all you need to do once you're and here is the is how you add the conditional styling invisibility for instance let's say i want uh this new business field to glow green uh you know whenever the type is new business i want this to glow green if it is existing business orange some you know condition like that then in order to add a canvas rule you to click on this field you know go to this plus button here then create canvas rule glow green or new business something like this you can name the rule and choose the criteria if type is new business so for this particular condition you're going to apply a style which is let the background glow green there you go okay so by default it will be you know there is no selection if the condition is met that is if the type changes to new business that field will start glowing green like this you can build this kind of rule for any data confidence simply click that uh you know data component and start adding your rule and you can start applying your styles and for visibility you know for every component you have a show or hide setting here you can apply that so based on a particular rule let this section be hidden otherwise let it be shown so you can decide what is required and go ahead and configure your rules so this is how your canvas builder works so all you need to remember is how you want your data to be packaged what illustrations to use what data actually goes into the builder and how every component gets styled so once you decide this for every component you know slowly start building company complete your page will be complete save the page example view for instance so once you save the page you get this option to assign canvas so this is where you decide who gets to see what view by default so here in our example we've said the real estate agent should see the agent view the marketing specialist should see the marketing view and so on client portal i have assigned the client portal view so this is how the canvas assignment also works once you've assigned and deployed these views with respect to profiles they can start working with it okay close and canvas also supports inline edit which means you can you know edit your pieces of information right here on the canvas view you know edit option is here if you want to change the owner you can you know do this from here all this is supported okay it supports inline edit as well as the portal view so this is what you need to know to sort of get started and just to quickly summarize getting started works like this you add key components in elements add your data and operations resize and organize components the way you want apply styles for each data component assign canvas and you're good to go so that's about it that's about our demo i mean i hope this has given you an idea good enough idea to get started with the canvas builder we would love for you to try this and get back to us with your thoughts thank you

what if you could redefine your zoho crm user experience all by yourself sounds like a dream well it's now a reality you can now rebuild your crm pages from scratch using canvas a zero code design platform that gives you a 360 degree view of your customers and includes related opportunities key insights and associated activities all in one place redesign the page to your liking in terms of design data organization and functionality let's explore the enormous possibilities that you can achieve with canvas by looking at some specific examples of each key feature with this you can leverage all of the available options to build what you need this video will provide you with necessary insights ideas and pointers required to get you started on your canvas journey brand consistency why settle for a basic blank crm template that doesn't align with your brand's visual identity when you can build your own redesign your crm page to communicate your company's personality and purpose to the users by making it visually coherent with the brand's identity and providing a flexible user interface this helps bring in evident and consistent similarities between your website crm email templates brochures and other marketing materials that the user can easily identify for example here is a canvas page created for the contacts module of zilker real estate we see their logo up here and the page follows a certain theme that is also seen on their website in this example of a page designed for food delivery companies several visual cues to represent who they are and what they do alternatively if you do not want to carry forward themes from your website you can create a unique design from your crm pages a design that is reminiscent of your products and services and informal company culture organization of data elements if you're not a fan of conventional page design or if you think that the way data is arranged by default makes it difficult for you to find details that you need then you can organize data elements based on your needs rearrange data you can rearrange data to make top priority fields prominent on the page so that your sales reps don't have to spend time hunting down key information color coding data our minds associate with colors much quicker than black and white labels this enables you to highlight key information with specific colors to indicate its importance tabular representation of data you can also use tables separators and tabs to package data well in order to use the available page space efficiently for instance here in this zoker real estate example we see that the contact details of the customer are placed on the top left corner of the page so that it's the first thing someone sees as soon as they land on it the key details are highlighted and you also see different elements used to package data such as tabs and sections similarly in the food delivery company crm we see that the key parties involved are clearly mentioned along with order details a vertical separator is used to compartmentalize these details visually the required action buttons are seen on the right and further fields are arranged in sections and tabs use of illustrations illustrations can be used for visually representing corresponding data it is a straightforward and hassle-free way of handing out key information because apart from being visually appealing it allows for contextual and meaningful data representation for instance the silker real estate contacts page has illustrations for phone numbers email ids and twitter handles it goes well with the design and also instantly grabs the viewer's attention while saving screen space similarly in the food delivery company example we have illustrations to represent a specific location the symbol is enough to indicate an address we also have illustrations such as an address book to refer to a customer a delivery truck to indicate the delivery agent and a set of spoons to indicate a restaurant in this example of a healthcare crm one can figure out heart rate and temperature with these efficiently used illustrations other frequently used illustrations include that of a folder dollar sign euro pound arrows house and so on you can browse the gallery of icons to pick a desired illustration and place it on your page related list components customization or customer 360. canvas offers a 360 degree view of customer data that is not only can you access data on the primary record but get a complete view of related records as well for instance in this example of zilker real estate you see the contact details of the customer this is information on the primary record but you also see associated details such as activities properties associated deals and so on as you may know these are called related lists in crm not only can you see a list of deals properties associated but you can also customize the related list component that is you can bring the fields of your choice from this related module and display it on its primary module similarly in the example of the food delivery company you can see order details customer details as well as restaurant details these are related lists customized using canvas as a consequence canvas enables you to get a complete 360 degree view of a particular record in a single place without having to navigate anywhere else in the crm conditional styling and visibility canvas offers a facility for you to style your data elements differently for different contexts for example you can design a deal record page in such a way that the deal amount field glows green if the deal amount is greater than five thousand dollars anything less than 5k would not have any highlights on it this way it's easy for a user to catch big deals quickly you can create conditions based on deal amount discounts and other different types of fields in crm here's another example to apply conditional styling say in the case of a travel agency using crm they want to change styles based on trip status if a trip is on the status glows green if a trip is cancelled or unsuccessful it glows red if it's waiting on any other stages it glows orange so when you go to a record just look at the colors and you get a big picture apart from conditional styling canvas supports conditional visibility that is you can show or hide a component based on a certain condition some examples include show email related list only if the record contains an email id otherwise keep the email related list component hidden show the guardian section only if the age is under 18 otherwise keep it hidden show the reason for failure section only if the order status is failed or declined otherwise keep it hidden you get the drift while you can use conditional styling to control how data appears based on conditions you can use conditional visibility to control what data components appear on a page and when so that it will help you declutter the page there you go these are the top notable features of canvas with corresponding examples we are confident that you are able to retain these ideas and apply them for your business context start designing your canvas page today
