there are monsters out there lurking in the dark for centuries astronomers scanned the heavens again and again without ever spying them but behind the familiar stars and nearby calm galaxies of our universe lay something far more vicious far more terrible and far more powerful completely invisible to the human eye you would never see them even on the darkest of Knights indeed at first they appeared as nothing but dim distant pin Pricks of strange radio emission but those pin Pricks revealed something no astronomer could ever have expected something so strange so bizarre that for years nobody even believed that they could exist that there must have been some mistake in our observations thankfully none are nearby for if they were any closer they would flood us our galaxy our solar system our planet with deadly radiation a single one of these monsters can easily pump out over 10 to the power of 40 Jews every second for comparison our sun outputs about 10 to the power of 34 Jews a million times less every year the brightest among them outshine Stars outshine galaxies outshine a thousand galaxies at once some extreme events like the most powerful supern noi can briefly become brighter than these beacons but those events are temporary ephemeral flaring and dimming in a matter of weeks when these monsters awaken they stay powered for millions of years in just a fraction of their lifetime they can easily produce more energy than even the most intense Cosmic explosions and they are hungry they feed on anything and are capable of tearing apart entire stars in a single fit of rage producing flashes of radiation and jets of charged particles that shoot out from millions of light years piercing through galaxies and spreading their destruction throughout entire clusters they are the quazars the most powerful engines in the known universe but what drives these engines what powers these lighthouses in the Deep the answer will take us on a journey through some of the most extreme physics in the universe and even provide us with a grim warning for though our galaxy is quiet now it will not stay that way [Music] forever the most distant quazar from us is 13 billion light years away it would take nearly the entire history of the universe to travel to and that's without the universe expanding at the same time space is big and getting bigger and sometimes that can

they were seeing by the 1950s science had grown used to the idea of galaxies outside the Milky Way But even in this expanded cosmological view the belief was that the Universe was relatively small only a few billion light years across at most and that expanded Cosmos seemed relatively simple even boring there were galaxies there were were clusters of galaxies there were vast expanses of nothingness for a Time astronomers were able to convince themselves that they were finally starting to figure things out but in the mid 20th century there was a technological Revolution optical telescopes capable of seeing objects inv visible wavelengths of light were becoming enormous and our ability to use the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum wavelengths of light outside the visible grew along with that and with these new observations came the realization that the Universe was Far weirder than we could have ever imagined one of the first revolutions was in radio in the 1930s the pioneering engineer Carl jansky solved the problem of how to reduce noise in sensitive radio antenna and discovered the first radio signals coming from deep space among many bright and obvious sources like Jupiter The Crab Nebula and nearby galaxies astronomers also discovered numerous small faint distant pointlike radio objects these strange objects appeared all over the sky emitted radio waves at a broad range of wavelengths and could not be seen with visible or infrared telescopes the only clue they gave was their position they appeared both within the band of the Milky Way and outside of it since our galaxy is a thin d disc this meant that the sources either had to be extremely close like the visible stars of the night sky or extremely far away like the distant galaxies but if they were close we should have been able to see them in Optical wavelengths and if they were extremely far away their intensity in radio wavelengths implied they were the brightest objects in the entire universe understandably many astronomers pushed back against this interpretation not only arguing about their distance but also openly questioning what could possibly power something that bright finally a breakthrough came in 1962 by the 1960s astronomers had been able to refine the techniques of radio astronomy to the point they could more precisely measure the location on the sky of these strange sources with these new techniques astronomer seral Hazard and John Bolton found that one radio Source known as 3c273 would undergo occultations of the Moon allowing them to provide an extremely accurate estimate of its position following up on that work the Dutch American astronomer Martin Schmid discovered a faint object in the same location in the visible spectrum within that visible light Schmidt found the usual collection of bright spectral lines and dark gaps the Fingerprints of elements and molecules found throughout the cosmos but these lines were not in their usual wavelengths instead they were shifted towards the red end of the Spectrum by nearly 16% to get that kind of red shifting either 3c273 had to be moving away from us at an incredibly fast speed or it had to be incredibly far away by this time astronomers had been slowly accepting The Big Bang Theory of the universe The View that the cosmos was once smaller in the past and is continuing to grow in the present day under cosmological expansion light from distant objects red shifts because the space between them and US expands stretching the light out into longer wavelengths and when he interpreted the red shifting of the light from 3c273 Schmidt realized it sat 3.4 billion light years away it was the most distant object by an order of magnitude ever observed in 1966 Time Magazine put Martin Schmidt on its cover comparing the magnitude of his Discovery to those of Galileo saying the 17th century Italian startled scientists and theologians alike the 20th century Dutchman has had an equally jarring effect on his own contemporaries 3c273 was a revelation it is so distant that it appears to us as simply a pointlike object of incredible luminosity in fact making it another recordbreaker it was also the brightest known object in astronomy at the time stranger still 3c273 was remarkably compact now knowing the location of the object astronomers dug back through archival photographic plates and found that earlier generations of astronomers had already seen it without recognizing it for what it was year after year 3c273 had shown up but its brightness had varied between annual observations to change brightness within a year an object must be smaller than a light year across because any changes to the object can only propagate at a speed lower than the speed of light So Not only was 3c273 Far brighter and far more distant than any known object it managed to accomplish both these Feats in a volume smaller than our solar system with this technique of matching radio sources to visible light objects in place astronomers went on to confirm the distances to dozens of these so-called quasi Stell radio sources the name coming about as early astronomers knew that these objects were not normal stars but had absolutely no clue what they actually could be it was in 1964 that the astrophysicist Hong Yi Chu coined its modern cater name in the journal physics today so far the clumsily long name quasi Stellar radio sources is used to describe these objects for convenience the abbreviated form quaza will be used throughout this paper and so the quazar was born debate over the true nature of quazars raged for decades within the astronomical Community many astronomers believe that the original interpretation was correct that these were incredibly bright incredibly Compact and Incredibly distant object objects but they could not explain what powered these extreme objects others continued to argue that these were some sort of exotic star much closer to our own Galaxy that provided such an extreme amount of gravitational pull that light escaping from them would red shift making them appear much more distant than they really were but it wasn't one decisive measurement that cemented the cosmological nature of quazars but rather a gradual buildup of observational pressure which grew handin hand with the acceptance of the Big Bang The Big Bang Theory tells us that the Universe changes with time Not only was it smaller in the past it was also different quazars only appear in the extremely distant Universe indeed the nearest quazar sits over 700 million light years away since astronomy acts like a time machine with more distant observations revealing the nature of a younger Universe these observations tell us that quazars were only active in the distant part past and have now gone quiet this idea fits perfectly with the big bang because we expect the universe to change as it evolves with time our Dawning understanding of the age and size of the universe helped paint a portrait of a gigantic ancient Cosmos that could easily accommodate the distances to even the most far-flung quaza and so astronomers were left with little choice they had to accept that these strange intense objects were truly far away and truly bizarrely [Music] bright as news of the discovery of quazar worked its way from purely astronomical circles and into the popular imagination public interest skyrocketed with writers using the term to elicit a sense of strangeness and remoteness and if you need a new nursery rhyme to soothe your child you can take the words of legendary physicist George gof twinkle twinkle quasi star biggest puzzle from afar how unlike the other ones brighter than a billion Suns twinkle twinkle quasi star how I wonder what you are meanwhile astronomers discovered more and more quazars including ones that were both unusual usually bright and oddly dim the very brightest ones got a new name blazars While others weren't emitting any radio waves at all but Were Somehow extremely bright in x-ray radiation and as radio astronomy became more sophisticated astronomers were able to capture smaller finer details the most famous example was signus a one of the brightest radio objects in the entire Sky initially thought to be an exotic Radio Star when it was first discovered by the 1950s astronomers realized it was far stranger the central core of signus a was a Galaxy but extending hundreds of thousands of Li years away from that core with two Thin long Jets ending in gigantic bubbles screaming in radio emission all of these strange objects whether loud or quiet in the radio were the relatively nearby or extremely distant shared one thing in common their cause were abnormally bright in some cases the nuclei of the galaxies outshone all the hundreds of billions of stars within the galaxies themselves the brightest of these cores indicated an enormous amount of activity of Unknown Origin without knowing the true explanation astronomers conceived of a brand new term to Encompass them all active Galactic nuclei and so what was going on in the cores of these galaxies why was some the most luminous objects in the universe While others were relatively quiet what generated the radio emissions and why did some blast out x-ray radiation astronomers had discovered a zoo of active galaxies throughout the cosmos with a dizzying and confusing array of Galactic creatures something must power them something must generate the energies needed to make the brightest of them outshine a thousand galaxies at once something must enable them to be seen from the the distant reaches of the far Universe these active Galactic nuclei must have something in common and it was clear that that something lived in their C and so to understand what drives these the most powerful engines in the known universe we have to look a little closer to home 25,000 light years away it'ss a monster we wouldn't know it by looking at it we can't see this monster with our own eyes we can't see it with telescopes but even decades ago we knew that something strange was there when we look out at the sky on a dark clear night we can see the band of the Milky Way the Milky Way is brightest in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and it it's there that astronomers discovered the core of our galaxy and when radio astronomers began their first hesitant explorations of the sky they also found a bright source of radio emission coming from this point later astronomers building a catalog of radio sources ranked the brightest object in each constellation in alphabetical order and so the bright Source in Sagittarius became known as Sagittarius A still later more Det detailed observations revealed an exceptionally bright point-like object buried within the larger Sagittarius a complex because the discovery was exciting and excited States and atoms get labeled with an asterisk the modern name for the object at the very center of the Milky Way was born Sagittarius A star it was the same problem posed by the distant quazars but much closer to home what could possibly power the bright radio emissions coming from the the center of our galaxy and so they pushed deeper into the Maelstrom and deep within the core of Sagittarius A star astronomers found Stars pin Pricks of light dancing and swirling repeated observations showed that the stars were orbiting around some unseen companion Bound by chains of gravity to something massive and something dark simple calculations of orbital mechanics revealed the mass of the the central object forcing scientists to acknowledge the existence of an entity weighing over 4 million solar masses debates swirled for decades but eventually only one plausible answer remained Sagittarius A star was a super massive black [Music] hole black holes are common throughout the Universe most the leftover remnant of a massive star these black holes are usually relatively small weighing only a few times the mass of the Sun but the mysterious object at the center of our galaxy weighed millions of times the mass how could such a giant black hole form and how could it find itself at the center of our galaxy in 2022 all debate on its identity was put to rest when the Event Horizon telescope unveiled their stunning image of sag arus AAR using a network of telescopes spanning the entire Globe The Event Horizon telescope team spent years carefully combining and correlating their data the result was a blurry low resolution image of the true nightmare sitting within our Galaxy's heart a fuzzy ring of superheated plasma swirls around an evacuated core of pure Blackness at the very center lies the black hole itself its vent Horizon preventing any background light from traveling through it but the immense mass of the super massive black hole distorts gravity to such a degree the light behind the black hole can instead curve up and around the Event Horizon giving us a view behind the monster the black hole itself appears larger than it really is again due to the extreme warping of SpaceTime lines of sight that would normally graze past the edge of the Event Horizon instead wrap around it from our perspective the globe of the black hole unfolds itself revealing every angle of it in a single image producing what's known as the shadow that extreme gravity capable of bending and distorting light like a funhouse mirror reaches out to the surroundings of the black hole stars that Whip too close to the event horizon risk their Doom if they pass within a CR iCal distance the gravitational forces tear the star apart in a process called a tidal disruption event most of the gas however settles into a distant orbit around the black hole but 25,000 Li years worth of gas and dust sit between us and the center of our galaxy that gas and dust scatters and absorbs most wavelengths of light preventing us from seeing the Sagittarius a complex directly indeed if we could it would be one of the brightest objects in the sky radio waves however pass through the interstellar medium relatively unaffected which is why we only saw the first hints of trouble when we turned our radio observatories towards that constellation but despite the Fearsome radiation pouring out of the gas surrounding it the black hole itself was relatively quiet it was nothing like the distant quazars with their luminosities millions of times higher indeed except for a faint smudge of radio emission from outside our galaxy you wouldn't even know that a super massive black hole was there but still the question was asked could these be related could black holes power the quazar if our galaxy hosted a super massive black hole perhaps others did too as cosmologists began to understand the Big Bang Theory more fully they realized that structures in the universe had to grow slowly long ago there were only small differences in density across the cosmos with hardly any variations but over the course of hundreds of millions of years those density differences grew at large cosmological scales the only force that really matters is gravity a patch of matter with a slightly higher density will attract its neighbors pulling more matter onto it that will give it an even stronger gravitational pull which will in turn pull even more matter towards it and so on in a never ended feedback loop that drives small structures to become big ones leading eventually to the first Stars clusters and galaxies all this gravitational action leads to incredibly High densities in the cores of these structures it's simply where matter piles up the most the cores of galaxies host many stars and those stars are much more massive than average they live short lives and quickly die becoming black holes and packed into such small volumes the black holes quickly merged together their sizes growing out of control becoming super massive the idea that black holes could power quazars was first proposed in 1964 just a year after the identification of the first quazar itself but most astronomers rejected the idea outright after all at the time black holes were considered a wild and probably unys hypothesis Einstein's general relativity was certainly a radical reshaping of our understanding of gravity but that didn't mean that every corner of its mathematical structures had to be replicated in the universe the concept that matter could compress so tightly that no other Force could withstand it was outlandish surely some process would stop a dead star from catastrophically collapsing into a point of infinite density but then astronomers came across an intriguing system known today as signus XY a bright source of X-ray radiation in the constellation signus the swan astronomers spent years trying to understand how this star could produce so many x-rays until observations later in 1972 by astronomers Luise Webster Paul murdin and Charles Thomas Bolton revealed that it was not one star but two the x-rays came not from the invisible companion itself but from the swirling plasma surrounding it detailed observations of that plasma allowed astronomers to calculate the mass and more importantly the density of that companion whatever it was it was more compact than any known star and more compact than any Star possibly could be famed astrophysicist Steven Hawking even bet against the possibility of signus X1 containing a black hole saying in his book a brief his of time that when we made the bet in 1975 we were 80% certain that signis X1 was a black hole by now 1988 I would say that we are about 95% certain but the BET has yet to be settled 10 years later he finally conceded defeat signus X1 was the first confirmed black hole with black holes known to exist everything clicked into place the universe read created Stellar Mass black holes these black holes could merge and consume material swelling them to epic proportions and these Giants would find themselves in the centers of most if not all galaxies and so observations confirmed that everywhere we looked every Galaxy hosted a super massive black hole we couldn't see them they were and continued to be too far away to allow us to monitor their orbiting Stars directly and for all the sophistication of the event telescope besides our own Sagittarius A star it has only managed to capture an image of one other Galactic core but astronomers could use the brightness of the quazar themselves as a way to measure the mass of their Central black holes if supermassive black holes did power quazars then they could use Doppler shifting to estimate the Black hool's Mass but for this to work the black holes had to somehow power the quazars how could they do that if black holes are purely gravitational how could something that only pulls on the surrounding matter produce such Fier some [Music] energies the red claxons blare and a moment later you feel your ship shuddering jolting uncontrollably the stresses on the hull are almost too much threatening their integrity together with the alerts flashing on your display comes a new ominous warning chime a flood of cosmic rays have struck the ship microscopic particles slipping through the molecular structures and straight into the hearts of the crew but you are determined to go on you push your ship forward allowing it to slip into the swirl of plasma in a relativistic frenzy you don't even bother trying to control it anymore as the forces here are so strong so far beyond known physics that there's no choice but to give in to their Mercy the ship is in uncontrolled freefall a quick glance at a side readout reveals what you already suspected the external temperature is reaching millions of degrees with the internal life support systems beginning to fail gripping the armrest you can do nothing but watch as system after system fails frustrated you swipe away the warnings there's nothing new they can tell you after yet another final lurge one strong enough to throw you again your restraints to the point of bruising comes a sudden relief silence you bring up the warnings they're clear the temperature outside has plummeted to nearly absolute zero the cosmic rays have vanished the radiation subsided your ship is still in free fall but stabilized no longer tumbling you activate the external cameras shielding retracts revealing the Optics sending their feet directly to your display and there Dead Ahead you see it or rather you don't the reason you launched this mission to the center of the Galaxy in the first place the black [Music] hole the Deep Hearts within the cor of galaxies are complicated busy places like City centers there are far more stars than average compressed into uncomfortably small volumes like City dwellers crammed into tiny Apartments Street after Street there are also far more aging red giants located here a testament to the ability of The Cools of galaxies to produce greater numbers of the most massive stars but within all this brightness and intensity is a dark side astronomers estimate that the core of our own Galaxy hosts tens of thousands of smaller black holes a retinue in service to their Master at the center countless Supernova detonations gravitational tidal interactions and more tear Stars apart their tattered remains scattered among the close- packed Stars nothing much lasts long in the intensity of the core and among all that chaos sits a thick ring of cold dust a choking ring of smog within the central city it is wide around a thousand lie thick and the dust slowly circles around the center it's also as thick as it is is wide forming a gigantic Taurus and is so cold that the molecules and dust within it are neutral if you were to travel through it you would hardly notice it due to its low density but that Dusty Taurus obscures our view of most Galactic cores as it efficiently absorbs most of the radiation coming from within only when we look from above or below do we get a direct view of the Maelstrom while Cal and nonviolent itself that ring of dust signals an important transition point in the galaxy outside the ring you were in the galactic environment the suburbs the physics dominated by all the gravitational and electromagnetic forces of the Galaxy at large but within the ring only one thing matters the super massive black hole it is the central Landmark to guide all lost Travelers while even the largest ones take up less than 1% of the total Galactic Mass they are by far the most massive singular objects within a galaxy far enough away from them like our own solar system is away from Sagittarius A star we don't feel or even notice the black hole but within the Taurus of dust the gravity of the black hole takes over within this region the black hool's gravity dictates the motion of every Star every clump of gas and every Speck of dust it's here that some Stars stray dangerously close their orbital motions bringing their speeds up to a few percent of the speed of light if they get too close they're torn to shreds their atoms joining the trains of gas on their Dreadful March towards the Event Horizon even closer to the black hole that gas begins to lose control unable to dictate its own motion it gets lost in the crowded frenzy funneling to incredible speeds driven by the extreme gravitational environment it is this process that releases an incredible amount of energy from the simple Act of falling and to get an estimate of the amount of energy released we look at something called The Binding energy to understand binding energy imagine wanting to move a pile of stones sitting at the bottom of a valley to move the pile you must grab each individual Stone and bring it to the top of the ridge every time you do this you just overcame the gravitational potential energy of the stone you can estimate how much energy you'll need for the entire task by calculating the potential energy of all the stones now imagine pulling these stones from the bottom of the valley and sending them so far out into space that they never come back now repeat that for every single atom of the earth effectively destroying the entire Earth in the process the amount of energy you would need to obliterate our planet is called The Binding energy for a black hole imagine dragging a particle from The Event Horizon all the way out to a distance of a few thousand light years fighting against the gravity of the black hole the entire time that is The Binding energy of the particle around the black hole which is equal to the energy released when the particle Falls from that distant orbit into the Event Horizon and for a typical super massive black hole that energy is roughly equal to the rest mass energy of the matter itself this process isn't perfect and not all the energy available is released as the particle Falls usually only about 10% of The Binding energy converts into other forms that may not seem like a lot but compare that efficiency to the 0.1% of the rest mass energy released by thermonuclear reactions in the hearts of stars but this process doesn't lead to an uncontrolled release of energy like a b instead the release is slower and in stages a steady buildup of excitement as material continues to cram towards the black hole as the gas heats up it emits radiation normally radiation only makes things warm but the intensity here is so high that the radiation has a pressure it is so intense that it can push on things imagine the Summer Sun so strong it literally could knock you over the radiation pushes the gas heating it up even more and sending it away from the black hole but with the gas pushed away it can't continue accreting and so the radiation dissipates but eventually the gas cools down again allowing it to condense towards the black hole and repeat the accretion process this cycle of collapse and inflation acts like the piston in a car engine keeping the flow of gas in check preventing it from suddenly crashing into the black hole all at once and keeping quazar Shining for millions of years yet that is just the beginning for the gravity around super massive black holes does not work alone as any surrounding gas funnels towards the black hole its orbital speed increases by simple conservation of angular momentum an ice skater can pull their arms closer to their body to increase their rotation speed and so can material will speed up as it whls closer to the black hole but eventually its inward movement is slowed the rotation supported by centripetal acceleration like a planet locked in orbit around a star and so soon enough the loose collection of orbiting gas and dust compresses into a tight thin disc of accretion around the super massive black hole all that infalling and compression heats the gas to incredible temperatures the gravitational potential energy surrounding the black hole converted into heat friction and radiation a simple matter of too much material cramming into too small of a volume the disc glows primarily at ultraviolet wavelength but also across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum in addition the dis constantly streams out Showers of high energy particles known as cosmic rays electrons and protons accelerated to nearly the speed of light those microscopic bullets can occasionally St like a Wandering low energy Photon at infrared or visible wavelengths and when that happens the particles transfer their energy to the photons turning them into high energy x-rays the intense heat of the disc causes the cold atoms and molecules to unbind themselves forming an electrically charged plasma the same state of matter as Lightning these rapidly moving electric charges around the black hole create a magnetic field and very quickly it generates the conditions needed to power a Dynamo a seemingly infinite supply of energy that can turn a small magnetic field into something devastating initially within the disc the magnetic field lines follow the motion of the gas swirling in Rapid circles around the black hole but the innermost regions of the disk rotate far faster than the outer regions forcing the magnetic field lines to coil up on themselves storing up a tremendous amount of energy the most of the gas within the disc isn't smooth and steady instead it's chaotic and turbulent like a running River with portions of gas clumping and colliding waving back and forth as they swirl in The Firestorm when a clump of this gas drifts away from the disc it pulls on the magnetic field like a bit of string but the difference in rotation from one section of the disc to another twists that Loop of the magnetic field around itself the action of rotation eventually stretches that magnetic field back down into the disc this is a Dynamo at work which turns chaotic turbulent motions in the disc into an increasingly strong magnetic field surrounding the black hole normally magnetic fields don't affect the Motions of matter except in very small ways but as the magnetic forces ratchet up within the accretion disc surrounding the giant black hole they begin to dominate The Motions of material the closer the gas gets to the black hole the more unstable the orbits become and there is a certain special distance known as the innermost stable circular orbit any gas that falls below that orbit is doomed most of the gas Falling Towards the black hole ends its life at the Event Horizon never to be seen again but some gets caught in in the twisting and winding Paths of the magnetic field lines their force is so strong that they Channel and guide the gas as it falls but how does this lead to the radar pin Pricks we see in the distant sky that is still a bit of a mystery one hypothesis is called the Blandford sagc process named after the two physicists who came up with the idea the key to this idea is the fact that the black hole itself is rotating when it does it drags SpaceTime in the region around it like moving a heavy coffee table twists the rug beneath this region called the ergosphere forces any object entering into it to rotate along with the black hole this includes magnetic fields the strong magnetic fields within the dis punch in and out of the ergosphere which forces them to twist up on themselves twisting Fields create a tube of magnetic energy stretching above and below the black hole While most of the charged particles following those magnetic field lines end up plunging below the Event Horizon some just barely scratch the surface accelerated by the extreme magnetic energies within the ergosphere following the lead of the field lines the charged particles race away from the black hole in the form of long thin Jets of radiation Lighthouse beams racing out into the dark this radiation is primarily composed of radio waves and it is here that we finally find the origins of quazar the particles in the Jets are incredibly powerful accelerating to nearly the speed of light they race out of the galactic core and punch through the Galaxy altogether stretching for up to millions of light years eventually however they lose steam the particles interacting with the intergalactic medium that surrounds every Galaxy when they finally stop they create a high press zone of charged particles these bubbles transfer heat all the way from the innermost regions surrounding the super massive black holes into the volumes of entire clusters of galaxies which can stretch for over a million light years across that is how powerful these systems are not only can they be seen from across the cosmos but they can raise the average temperature of entire galaxy clusters the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe this picture involving super massive black holes the Ring of dust surrounding them the Ferocious secretion dis and the magnetized outflows explains almost every observation of active galaxies if we see the central core of a galaxy face on we see the intense radiation from the accretion disc combined with the strong radio emission from the Jet and we recognize it as a quazer if we happen to be looking directly down the barrel of the jet then we get the most extreme emission and we call it a Blazer it's like Humanity first encountering cats in astronomical observations sometimes they see the whiskers or a paw or a swishing tail initially these seem like completely different objects but over time we realize that they're really just different perspectives of the same kind of creature but what of other active galaxies that aren't even loud in the radio spectrum the solution here is that not every Galactic core is active to power aazar the black hole needs to feed without a supply of new material the entire system shuts down no gravitational collapse no accretion disc no twisting magnetic fields no relativistic Jets no nothing this picture also explains why we see no quazars in the nearby Universe active Galactic nuclei can last for incredibly long times the longest running quazar can run for over a million years but they require constant streams of new material to feed their fires the early Universe was much smaller than it is today with galaxies much closer together and undergoing frequent mergers with every merger new material Finds Its way to the center of the Galaxy setting off a feeding event a new round of quazar activity but today with the universe much older and far larger Galaxy merges do not happen often with no new supplies of gas we see no quazars in the local volume of the cosmos indeed our own Galactic core is quiet although Sagittarius A star hosts Stars dust and gas around it it's a relatively empty region compared to the cause of quazars but this was not always the case in 2010 astronomers using the firery gamma ray Space Telescope identified two gigantic regions stretching above and below the galactic plane each one over 50,000 liers across computer simulations revealed what caused them a feeding event several million years ago whether it was a cluster of stars or a Wandering clump of interstellar gas that met its end in the hungry Moore of Sagittarius AAR our black hole destroyed it quickly shredding it into an accretion disc around the Event Horizon and then the same physics went to work the acis disc energized a powerful magnetic field which created Jets and launched relativistic particles away from the Galaxy where they still sit [Music] today indeed it seems that every galaxy has gone through at least one active phase spending some of its life cycle as a quazar with the central core of the Galaxy bu a few light years across outshining not just its own galaxies but a thousand galaxies combined but despite our growing comprehension of the incredibly energetic forces powering these vast dynamos the quazar we see are still too bright the super massive black holes that serve as their gravitational power sources are also very very big too big and they are not the only issues astronomers continue to discover quazars appearing in the earlier and earlier Universe too early quazars seem impossibly big and impossibly bright existing impossibly early in the history of the cosmos what does this [Music] mean everything about qu our is the very definition of extreme the largest known super massive black hole weighs over 66 billion solar masses if you were to place that black hole in our own solar system with its Singularity at the center by the time you reach the orbit of Pluto you would be less than 1% of the way to its Event Horizon we currently know of around 1 million active quazar and suspect that there are at least 10 million more in the observable universe yet to to be seen each one pumping out more energy than a thousand galaxies combined each one a fierce engine of plasma and radiation and quazars have been with the universe almost since its birth the most distant known quazar named J z313 d186 was firing when our universe was only 670 million years old that's just 5% of its present age but astrophysicists aren't quite sure how these black hole appeared so early and got so big in the relatively Short age of the cosmos the only way that we know for sure how to make black holes is through the deaths of massive stars so by this Logic the first black holes couldn't exist until the first generation of stars lived and died if those early stars were like the stars of the modern Universe then they left behind black holes no more than a few times the mass of the sun from there the black holes had to grow and they have two options available merging and accreting matter black holes especially massive ones don't merge all that often at least theoretically initially when two black holes encounter one another interactions with their environments allow them to draw closer together but eventually all that's left between them is their own gravitational pole as the black holes wind around each other they emit gravitational waves leaves which pulls energy out of the system and allows the black holes to sneak closer together once the black holes are within a few light years of each other sufficient gravitational wave emission alone would take longer than the age of the universe and astronomers still don't have a solution to this obstruction calling it the final parek problem yet despite this we do know they merge for we have detected signature ripples in SpaceTime from merger events with gravitational wave detectors and when we scan the cosmos for super massive black holes we usually find only one residing in each Galactic core despite each Galaxy having suffered multiple merger of events so although the universe has clearly solved the final Parc problem we don't yet know how however even the most optimistic estimates for Black Hole production and merger rates can't explain the largest and earliest quazars so that leaves accretion to give black holes their exceptional masses but once again we run into a problem the same seaing of radiation and gravitational collapse that keeps quazar illuminated for millions of years prevents large amounts of gas from reaching the black hole quickly this process is known as the Edington limit and while not a hard and fast rule of the universe it does present a challenge if black holes are to reach super massive status they need to find a clever way around this and somehow shove extra material through the Event Horizon without heating it up to the point that it escapes the vicinity of the black hole compounding this problem is the lack of observational evidence for so-called intermediate Mass black holes these black holes should sit in a mass range well above Stellar Mass black holes which weigh only up to to a few dozen times the mass of the Sun and Below super massive black holes which weigh millions or billions of solar masses we should see these in between Class black holes everywhere representing an intermediate stage of growth between the Stellar mass and super massive black holes but we don't on the other hand the results from gravitational wave detectors suggest that black holes emerging far more often than we had initially assumed in order to get the detection rates that we observe many small black holes had to have merged in the history of the universe meaning that they find each other close their orbits and merge quite efficiently in addition those same results suggest that there are many more small black holes than we had initially assumed based on simple Stellar deaths the result is a confusing Tangled mess it is clear our understanding of the growth and evolution of black holes is missing something traditional models of galaxy star formation don't seem to be cutting it so perhaps it's time to turn to more exotic [Music] models one possibility is that dark matter itself can directly collapse to form black holes dark matter is the dominant form of matter in the universe making up roughly 80% of the mass of every single Galaxy but in the simplest models of dark matter it doesn't interact with itself and so has difficulty clumping together at small scales when it comes to something like a Galaxy most theorists assume that the dark matter is roughly evenly spread out but in some more complicated models of this mysterious form of matter it is capable of small infrequent interactions with itself this would cause it to Clump together rapidly especially in the high density days of the early universe and if enough Dark Matter clumps into a small enough volume quickly enough then its own gravitational weight can take over leading to catastrophic collapse and the formation of a giant black hole a black hole potentially big enough to begin powering quazars before the first Stars had even Arisen another possibility is that our assumptions about star formation don't apply in the early Universe in today's Cosmos Stars can only get so large this is because the nebul that collapse to form them can only grow to a certain size before they begin to efficiently lose their heat and collapse but that efficient cooling depends on the presence of heavier elements to radiate away the energy of the nebula the early Universe however lacked such heavier elements because massive stars have to live and die to enrich the interstellar medium so perhaps Stars hundreds of times more massive than the sun could have formed when those giant Stars die they would leave behind much larger black holes or perhaps the solution is something even more exotic maybe black holes have been with us since the earliest moments of the Big Bang in this scenario the Exotic conditions and phase transitions of the first few seconds in the history of the universe spawned countless small black holes known as primordial black holes though many observations have ruled out the existence of black holes like these there is still the possibility of their existence there may not be a lot of them but if enough survive into the age of Galaxy formation they could provide a shortcut to quazar building bypassing the usual root of star and black hole formation it's these questions and many more that provided motivation to build the James web Space Telescope which is currently probing the first generations of stars galaxies and quazars to appear in the universe regardless of these Mysteries one thing has become clear galaxies and their super massive black holes are inextricably linked together and the formation of quazar plays a key role in that relationship and in the early 2000s astronomers made a startling realization it's not just simply a matter of every known Galaxy hosting a super massive black ho at its Center but the properties of that black hole are closely linked to the properties of the host Galaxy for example the greater the black hole Mass the higher the temperature in the galactic core and the higher the Stellar velocity within and the larger the black hole is the more massive the overall Galaxy is and so it appears that super massive black holes don't evolve independently of their host galaxies and turning on and off quazar activity plays a key role in that self-regulating connection if a Galaxy accretes a lot of material either by gravitational attracting gas and its surroundings or by cannibalizing another galaxy that Galaxy now has a lot of new material to boost star formation but a lot of that material winds its way into the core which turns into an accretion disc and launches a jet turning the core of the Galaxy into a quazar all that radiation envelops the black hole's host Galaxy heating the entire contents of its interstellar medium if the gas is too hot stars can't form efficiently this means that what would have been a burst of sudden star formation turns into a steady trickle but this is good for the Galaxy too much star formation at once would use up all the available reservoirs of gas which would ultimately end star formation too soon but the quazar acts like a break preventing too many stars from forming in a short period of time it seems almost every galaxy has gone through a quazar phase and these galaxies continue to regularly pump out new stars at a predictable efficient rate this quazar back and forth explains the relationship between galaxies and their super massive black holes when the Galaxy grows larger so does the black hole and feedback from La quazar keep star formation in check and this also applies to our own galaxy The Milky Way Grew From countless merges and cannibalization of smaller galaxies and each one of these interactions could have flooded the Galaxy with so much new material that star formation became uncontrolled using up all the available gas in just a few hundred million years but Sagittarius A star kept us in check preventing stars from forming too quickly indeed it could be that without Sagittarius AAR activating as aaza deep in our distant past then our own Sun may never have formed and we may never have been here but this happy equilibrium will not last long in 5 billion years our galaxy will begin to merge with our nearest neighbor the Andromeda galaxy our two supermassive black holes will find each other and also merge material tattered remnants of stars and nebuli destroyed by the gravitational forces of the merger will find its way into the new core and when it does the slumbering Giant in the center will reawaken activating its Mighty engines of gravity and magnetic fields and pouring its tirelessly Fierce radiation into the new Galaxy snuffing out any hopes of peace and quiet for ages to come you've

you should not exist neither should your family or your neighbors or the person who served you in the supermarket earlier today the world should not exist there shouldn't be any great art or music there shouldn't be hunger or the horrors of War there shouldn't be any of it there shouldn't even be a universe let's begin at the beginning at the big bang and plausible and unlikely event a one in 10 to the 10 to the 123 charts 10 to the 10 to the 123 is sometimes called the Penrose number named after the Nobel prize winning British physicist and mathematician sir Roger Penrose it measures the remarkable level of order and precision with which our universe was created order and precision are known to Decay over time you see it with the wires that lead into an old pair of headphones getting more and more Tangled As Time Goes By You See It in the crumbling ruins of an ancient city magnificent buildings carved thousands of years ago by our ancestors reduced to dust and Rubble by the passage of time penr knew that our universe should behave in the same way its order and precision decaying over time just like the cities of ancient Egypt China and meso America he knew that black holes were the crumbling ruins of the cosmos the place where everything ends up eventually where order and precision finally give way to the abyss there are about 10 to the power of 80 protons neutrons and other similar particles scattered across our universe still evading the abyss of black holes still Clinging On to their order and precision this makes our universe special like an ancient artifact that hasn't yet crumbled into dust and when he crunched the numbers Penrose realized that our universe must have been carved with a level of precision that just didn't make sense an incred incredibly low entropy a one in 10 to the 10 to the 123 chance and this impossible number is not alone antimatter is like the mirror image of matter and when the two combine they destroy each other and although there are 10 the^ of 80 protons neutrons and other matter particles in the universe there were only a sprinkling of antiparticles but this is just as well if there had been an equal number of particles and antiparticles created in the Big Bang they would have annihilated each other out of existence almost instantly and yet there is nothing in our best models of the universe that seems to give enough of a preference for matter over antimatter in fact when we extrapolate the results of experiments it looks like the universe should have been born with an equal number everything should have been annihilated you and I should not exist the universe should not exist and yet it does but there is one prediction that worries physicists far more than the lack of antimatter or the remarkably ordered state in which the universe was born it is the weight of the universe when theoretical physicists put quantum mechanics alongside G relativity in a controllable way they find that the Universe should have bent itself into Oblivion within a moment of creation it should have been crushed by an overwhelming weight most of which doesn't come from the planets and stars that are sprinkled throughout the Galaxy but from empty space the vacuum our entire universe should have been crushed by the weight of nothing this is a mystery known as the cosmological constant problem and

novium for supporting educational content on YouTube Julius Von mayor was a ship's Doctor Who served on expeditions to the Dutch East Indies in the middle of the 19th century whenever a sailor took ill on one of the ships Von mayor would often resort to bloodletting this wasn't unusual bloodletting was a common practice at the time and in in this case it led Von mayor to make a groundbreaking discovery in the hot sun of Indonesia he noticed that the blood running through a sailor's veins was just as red as the blood running through their arteries back home in his native Germany where the weather was not so warm the blood running through the veins of his patients was always a little darker than the arterial blood this was he believed because it was lacking in oxygen which had been used in the slow combustion of food to help keep the patient warm in Indonesia the sailors were bathed in tropical Sunshine they didn't need to burn as much fuel to stay warm so their veins carried blood with higher levels of oxygen and appeared much redder in color Von mayor realized that the heat generated from the combustion of food in the body must be equivalent to the heat absorbed from the sun he realized that heat was just another form of energy but what is energy and what does this have to do with the weight of the universe or even the cosmological constant energy is the most precious commodity of all we need energy to power our vehicles to heat our homes to watch videos on YouTube and as Von mayor realized it comes in many different forms in the 18th century early industrialists were looking for ways to convert trapped energy into useful work that could power their machines that is what energy is stuff that we can convert into work oldfashioned water wheels store potential energy by lifting a heavy bucket of water up high before allowing it to fall converting the energy into useful kinetic energy the energy of motion the steam engines of the Industrial Revolution took the chemical energy stored in coal converted that into heat before once again creating motion and it was Einstein who came to realize that mass was also another form of energy and to understand why we need to remember the cosmic speed limit the speed of light nothing can go faster than the speed of light which is about 299,792,458 m/s this limit applies to everything to the speed of a bullet or a particle whizzing around a collider it even applies to Usain Bolt the legendary Jamaican sprinter of course despite his remarkable Talent bolt never managed to get anywhere near the speed of light but what if he had what if there were a supercharged version of Usain Bolt capable of accelerating all the way up to the speed of light how could he do this to accelerate up to higher speeds The Supercharged bolt would need to take on energy presumably in the form of food as he approached the speed of light he would find it harder and harder to except accelerate this has to be the case if it were not he would be in danger of breaking the speed limit and we know that can't happen but what is it that stops him from accelerating it must be that his resistance to acceleration his inertia is getting bigger and bigger the energy he consumes isn't just going away it's being converted into inertia as he approaches the speed of light it doesn't matter how much energy he takes on board his inertia just grows and grows and stops him from accelerating beyond the speed limit with a thought experiment like this Einstein understood that inertia was just another form of energy and that had to remain true even when bolt wasn't running when he was at rest but what is Bolt's inertia when he is resting it's just his mass and so mass and energy are equivalent and Einstein captured this remark fact with his most famous equation e equal mc² this equation tells you how much energy e you should associate with a certain amount of mass m c in this case is the speed of light at around 300 million m/s that's quite a big conversion factor which means just a small amount of mass is equivalent to a huge amount of energy for example a small dog weighing around 9 kg stores energy equivalent to almost a million trillion jewles or 200 megatons of TNT that's roughly the energy that was released by the eruption of katoa in 1883 whenever nuclear fusion occurs a small amount of mass is converted into a huge amount of heat this happens inside a thermonuclear weapon as isotopes of hydrogen fuse together to form heavier elements with a net loss in the overall Mass it also happens in the core of the Sun powering the lifegiving glow that keeps our planet warm the conversion of mass into other forms of energy is one of the most powerful forces in nature and so when a physicist asks you how much you weigh or how much the universe weighs they aren't asking if you've eaten a little too much over the holidays they are asking about the force of gravity that pulls on you or indeed the universe of course how big it is May well depend on how much you've eaten over the holidays because we normally think of gravity as pulling on mass and the more mass you carry the more you weigh but this is only half the story gravity doesn't just pull on mass once Einstein had realized that mass and energy were equivalent he realized that gravity should pull on any form of energy light for example doesn't have any Mass but it does have energy and that's why gravity pulls it on a bent path around the sun when we ask how much you weigh or how much the universe weighs we are really asking how much energy there is and there is a huge amount of energy hiding in all the mass and radiation we see in the universe it is hiding in the stars and planets that populate the galaxies it is in the very radiation that spreads through the cosmos but this is only a small fraction of the total energy budget much of the universe is made from an unknown invisible Source the so-called Dark Universe this is where it gets most of its work weight and so just like gazing at your scales after the holidays or measuring how much flour you need for your cake it's time for us to weigh the [Music] universe in the city of Syracuse in the 3rd Century BC aredes arguably the greatest mathematician of his time is contemplating the size of the universe there are some who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of sic but also that which is found in every other region inhabited or uninhabited but Archimedes is not convinced by this infinite number of grains of sand and sets about calculating how many could actually fit inside the universe this is his famous sand reckoner and it begins with a poppy [Music] seed laying seeds out side by side Archimedes notes that 40 of them would make up a single Greek dactil a finger width equivalent to around 19 mm in modern units and within each seed he imagines a myriad grains of sand a myriad is 10,000 the largest unit available to Archimedes at the time to compute how many grains of sand there were in the universe he had to invent a new system of numbers and he also had to estimate the size of the universe to our comedies the universe reached as far as a blanket of fixed stars that formed an enormous sphere centered around the sun with a series of clever and crude approximations he estimated the diameter of this sphere to be equivalent to 100 trillion Greek stadia or about two Li years to us bringing everything together he triumphantly concluded that the Universe would not be able to accommodate an infinite number of grains of sand the number would not exceed 10 to the power of 63 how much would such a universe weigh well Archimedes wasn't really worried about that but if we imagine that each grain of sand weighs around 10 mg then aredes sandfill Universe would weigh about 10 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion kilog oddly that is not wildly incorrect [Music] but it was just a fluke Archimedes massively underestimated the size of the universe and the reality is it's not full of sand the universe is Big when we ask how much it weighs we are really asking how much energy it contains energy that is stored in the mass of the stars and planets and clouds of interstellar gas energy that is stored in radiation or even in empty space to figure out how much energy that is we need to be clear what we mean by Universe we mean the observable universe that is a large region of the universe as far as the eye can see or indeed anything else can see the universe was born about 13.8 billion years ago this might seem like a long time but it has not been enough time for us to receive signals from the most distant corners of the cosmos they are simply too far away even if they emit a light signal traveling at the maximum speed possible that signal would still not have reached Us in the lifetime of the universe this boundary between what we can and cannot see is known as the observable universe you might think that it must be about 13.8 billion light years in size since that is the distance traveled by light in the lifetime of the universe however this doesn't take into account the expansion of space when this is considered it turns out we could have received signals from objects that are up to 46.5 billion Li years away and so that is the size of the observable universe about 93 billion light years in diameter of course the universe doesn't actually stop at this point there isn't a giant Cosmic wall at 46 A2 billion light years but we have no way of knowing what it's really like Beyond this point it could be that the Universe goes on forever stretching all the way to infinity or perhaps it eventually comes back on itself like a magnificent Cosmic Sphere reaching far beyond the observable realm this giant sphere would bend the shape of space a little light traveling vast distances towards us could be sensitive to that bendiness and we could hope to detect it but so far we've detected nothing if the universe really is shaped like a sphere it would have to be undetectably large with a diameter of at least 23 trillion light years but whatever the size and shape of the universe there is no way we could try and weigh the unobservable Realms because we have no way of knowing what they contain they could be filled with grains of sand or they could be empty void of any stars and planets the laws of physics might even be different there we just don't know and we can never know so if we really want to be serious about weighing the Universe we need to stick to the observable part stretching 46 and 1/2 billion light years in every direction and weigh [Music] that let's start with the Stars the sun is fairly typical with a mass of order 2 million trillion trillion kilog observations suggest that there are between 100 and 400 billion stars in our galaxy which combine to weigh up to a billion ion billion trillion trillion kilog there are at least 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe each containing an average of 100 billion stars that suggests that there are at least 20 billion trillion stars alog together weighing a grand total of around 20,000 trillion trillion trillion trillion kilog and that's actually not a bad estimate for the stuff we can actually see but the problem is it neglects the mass of other sources stuff like Interstellar gas a better way to measure the mass or energy of the universe is to study its effect on the shape of SpaceTime one way to do this is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation the so-called CMB these are primordial photons left over from the moment the first atoms were formed these photons have traveled large distances across the entire universe from every different direction and throughout most of Cosmic history they could even be detected amongst the static in the old days of analog TV using state-of-the-art satellite telescopes astronomers measure the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation in different parts of the Sky by measuring the statistical correlations in the temperature fluctuations in the CMB and understanding how matter radiation and other forms of energy affect the shape of space and time astronomers are able to figure out what the universe is made of and the cosmic microwave background in combination with other methods and probes reveals that the observable universe has around 150,000 trillion trillion trillion trillion kilograms of mass stored in the stuff we can see stars planets clouds of interstellar gas and even the human race that's about 7 and a half times our previous estimate it sounds like a lot but the stuff we can see is only 5% of the energy out there there are two more ingredients and they dominate the universe first there is dark matter this is just like ordinary matter that makes up atoms or humans or stars or planets except it's completely invisible if you shine a torch on it the light will just pass through if you try to whack it with a baseball bat it would be as if you were just swinging the bat in empty space we have no way of touching or feeling Dark Matter except through gravity it carries mass and energy just like ordinary matter and so we can feel its effect on SpaceTime but although dark matter is five times more abundant than visible matter it's still not the dominant ingredient in our universe that is dark energy Dark Energy makes up a whopping 70% of the universe another invisible substance it is responsible ible for pushing the universe apart causing the cosmic expansion to Quicken over time we see this through the light from distant Supernova these explosions are reasonably well understood and yet the more distant ones are dimmer than expected this dimming is easily accounted for by The Accelerated expansion of space by the push of dark [Music] energy so just what is dark energy all the data points towards an exotic substance whose energy density is more or less constant right across the universe and as we will come to understand this is just what you'd expect from the energy of empty space empty space it turns out is not empty it is really a bubbling broth of virtual particles that can never be tamed that are forever popping in and out of existence weighing the Universe down giving it energy giving it weight this energy of empty space goes by many names in the early days of quantum mechanics most people called it the nul seni which is German for Zero Point Energy nowadays people often call it the vacuum energy or sometimes the cosmological constant they all mean the same thing and they are what most scientists associate with dark energy our observable universe can contains Dark Energy equivalent to around 46 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion tons of TNT and when you put everything together the planets the Stars the dark matter the dark energy you find a universe containing energy equivalent to 67 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion tons of TNT and that is how much the universe weighs this might seem like a lot but remember all this energy is spread evenly across a large Universe the density is very low dark energy is so dilute that a coffee cup full of it doesn't contain enough energy to crush a fairy fly the smallest insect in the world and that's just as well is this low density is what allowed the universe to grow large and old but in weighing the universe we now run into one of the greatest of all the cosmological puzzles the cosm logical constant problem if you really want to think about dark energy as the energy of empty space then why is there so little of it for when we take our most tried and trusted theories of physics at face value we find that the null Punk energy should be absolutely enormous our universe should not be the gently evolving Cosmos we see today it should have been born a super heavyweight instantly crushed under the weight of its vacuum bent into Oblivion in time and space torn to shreds by the tides of gravity and gone within the blink of an eye our universe should never have grown large and old it should never have allowed intelligent life to evolve it should never have allowed you to exist but our universe did grow large and old it did allow you to exist indeed the truth is the universe is not a heavyweight it's not even a flyweight so the question is why is there so little dark energy where is all the NP Punk enery why hasn't it destroyed the [Music] universe to understand the pun enerie and the puzzle it creates we have to travel back a 100 years to the German city of Hamburg to a cafe overlooking the banks of the inner aler Hamburg is a vibrant City risen From the Ashes of World War I a bustling metropolis and a center of intellectual thought and in the cafe are two physicists two friends uto Stern is a bon vion he enjoys the Finer Things in life good food good wine good company he sometimes takes a flight to Vienna just to have lunch Wolf Gang poy however is a very different character he is currently sporting a black eye sustained the night before in the bars of the reaper Barn in hamburg's Notorious San POI District poy had been brawling as he often did fueled by alcohol and a fiery personality Stern takes a sip of his Brandy and turns to his old friend I'm telling you Wolf Gang the Punk's energy is real I've calculated its effects on the vapor pressure of the Isotopes of neon if it were absent as you say it should be the difference in the vapor pressure of neon 20 and neon 22 would be enormous but poy isn't convinced he begins scribbling down a calculation on a napkin when he's done he looks up triumphantly but what of gravity Otto if the null Punk's energy were real as you say it should be the universe would not even reach the Moon Moon the null Punk energy is the energy of empty space the energy of the vacuum consider the universe around you it is filled with stars that shine their light throughout the cosmos from the Menace of red giants to the sickly glow of white dwarfs there are hostile planets in orbit around these stars giant and minnow too hot and too cold there are the warm and welcoming planets like the Earth jewels in the solar system where life can prosper there are towering clouds of gas monuments of colored nebula where stars are being born and all of this stuff carries Mass it carries energy but suppose a cosmic bayith were to enter the universe and take it all way they take away every Star every planet every human and all other forms of complex life they take away the nebula the black coals the bacteria and dust they take everything alive and dead large and small what would be left a dark and Silent place of true desolation the most empty of empty space naively you might expect this emptiness to be weightless to be free of all energy having been robbed of its Wares by The Cosmic bayth but that is not true at least we don't think it's true quantum theory has taught us that empty space does carry energy it carries the null puns energy the Zero Point Energy the vacuum energy the cosmological constant the celebrated German physicist and father of quantum mechanics Max plank had toyed with the idea of the nun seni as early as 1911 and soon after it was another German Walter nerst who suggested that the vacuum of empty space was not empty but an exotic medium filled with an enormous amount of energy but perhaps the most celebrated German physicist of the time Albert Einstein had a turbulent relationship with the nun seni and also separately the idea of a cosmological constant at first he was a champion of both indeed it was he who came up with the idea of a cosmological constant in 1917 requiring a repulsive Force present throughout all of space to counter the effect of gravity in what he believed at the time was a static Universe he also separately teamed up with auto Stern and computed the effects of the null pun enery on hydrogen molecules their results matching experimental data but he did not connect the two and within a decade Einstein had switched camps on both the cosmological constant and the nun seni supposedly calling the constant his biggest blunder and stating that no theoretician can utter the word Zero Point Energy without breaking into a half embarrassed half ironic smile but it would turn out that Einstein was right in his invoking of a cosmological constant and wrong in his dismissal of the nun enery and the idea of Zer Point Energy really took hold in the mid 1920s for this was when the legendary German physicist Vera Heisenberg entered the game struck down by severe hay fever in the summer of 1925 Heisenberg had fled to the island of heland where he checked into a guest house overlooking the dunes his allergies were so bad that the lady who ran the guest house assumed he'd been in a fight Heisenberg used his escape to think deeply about the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom thoughts that often led to insomnia and indeed it was in the early hours of one particular night that a breakthrough finally came and Heisenberg finally began to understand how the hydrogen atom behaved he was beginning to understand the sorcerer world of quantum mechanics where everything was a game of [Music] chance and as Heisenberg realized it was a game that led to the Zero Point Energy the null Punk zeni to understand how the Zero Point Energy emerges go to the kitchen and take out a large mixing bowl throw a marble into the bowl and wait for it to settle down eventually it'll seem as if it's at rest at the bottom of the bowl but is that really true can we really say exactly where it is and how fast it is moving if you zoom into the microw world the answer is clearly no there are air particles constantly colliding with the marble knocking it to and fro okay but what if you suck out all the air in the room and cool it down to absolute zero what then does the marble finally come to rest at the bottom of the bowl or does it wiggle it Wiggles Heisenberg realized that there was always some uncertainty the key thing to remember is that quantum mechanics is a game of chance you can only deal with probabilities it turns out that the more you know about a particle's position the less you know about its momentum so if we know where a particle is we cannot say how fast it is moving and vice versa this means that if we scale the marble down to the size of a fundamental particle we can never say if it is exactly at rest at the bottom of the bowl as that would mean we had exact knowledge of both its position and its momentum Heisenberg's understanding of uncertainty and the laws of quantum mechanics mean that it's simply not possible to know both exactly in the microscopic world something always has to wiggle and so now we can return to our Cosmic bayth deter determined to empty the universe of all its stars planets and Little Green Men before he arrives the universe is littered with particles electrons and photons quarks and gluons Gage bosons and higs bosons and perhaps even some particles we still don't know about these particles are in actual fact just ripples in the fundamental fields of nature the photon is a ripple in the electromagnetic field the electron a ripple in the electron field the higs boson a ripple in the higs field you can imagine these fields as an ocean swell and the particles as the ripples on top what the baith is really trying to do is get rid of all the ripples all the excitations of these fundamental Fields he is trying to silence the ocean of reality to make it perfectly flat but as we know he can't heisenbergs and un certainty principle means he can never silence the ocean completely there is always that Quantum wiggle tiny short-lived ripples in the fundamental Fields but these remaining ripples don't correspond to real particles like electrons or photons you can touch and perhaps even hang on to if they were real if you could hang on to them the bayith would just grab them and take them away instead they are something more mysterious they are virtual particles these virtual particles are forever popping in and out of existence like a bubbling broth in the vacuum of empty space they're not the kind of particles you can hang on to but they do give the vacuum its energy they give it the nulls energy but is this energy actually real or was it just a figment of Heisenberg's imagination there is a fascinating macroscopic example that helps to answer answer this question the gecko as it scampers freely across walls and ceilings its seemingly magical ability to defy gravity is thought to have its roots in the null Punk eneri it turns out that the energy stored in a vacuum through the bubbling broth of virtual particles depends crucially on the shape of its surroundings change the shape and you can change the energy that means that the vacuum will push and pull on the walls that surround it as it tries to lower its energy this push and pull of the vacuum is a force known as the Casmir Force named after the Dutch physicist hendrik Casmir when the walls of the vacuum are far apart this Casmir force is Tiny But when they're close together this force is big enough to measure changes in the Zero Point Energy also lead to Van deval's forces between atoms and molecules and this is what some biologists think is responsible for the gecko's ability to walk on walls microscopic projections on the soles of their feet surround small pockets of vacuum and by altering the shape the gecko creates a force strong enough to defy [Music] gravity and so now that we've accepted that the vacuum energy is real we can estimate how big we think it should be how much energy would you expect to find in a coffee cup of empty space to figure this out we need to break space up into lots of little pieces like a spectacular Cosmic jigsaw the size of the pieces is going to affect our estimate so we should think about what size we should use you might think the pieces should be as small as the eye can see that would make them little boxes about a millimeter across but why would we allow ourselves to be held back by the limitations of a human eye when poy was doing his calculation in the cafe in Hamburg he imagined jigsaw pieces with sides about a trillion times smaller at around a fentom meter this corresponds to the classical electron radius which was at the limit of experimental physics at the time and this is where Heisenberg comes in with his uncertainty if you can resolve the universe Into jigsa Pieces Just A femometer across you can have extremely precise knowledge about where and when a virtual particle pops in and out of existence Heisenberg says that must come a to price you must lose knowledge of the momentum of the particle this means you must also lose knowledge of its energy as you make the jigsaw pieces smaller and smaller the virtual particles can reach higher and higher energies for jig or pieces like Poes about a feter across these energies reach up to a few trillionth of a jewel for each of our little boxes that doesn't seem like much but remember the boxes are tiny so the density is dangerously High high for a coffee cup of empty space with lots and lots of these tiny little boxes the total energy stored inside the cup comes out to a whopping 100,000 trillion trillion Jews that's enough energy to boil away all the oceans of the Earth but why stop there it's been almost a century since poy performed his calculation in the cafe in Hamburg since then physics has moved on we've developed technology has enabled us to probe deeper and deeper into the microscopic fabric of the universe in the tunnels beneath the mountains on the Swiss French border lies the Large Hadron Collider cern's state-of-the-art particle accelerator a machine that recreates the first moments of the universe colliding subatomic particles head on at almost the speed of light these collisions allow physicists to PE deep into the microw world with unprecedented resolution breaking the universe up into pieces that at 10-19 M across that is 10,000 times smaller than an electron 10,000 times smaller than the jigsaw pieces po had imagined when you break down the universe into pieces this small you can resolve virtual particles popping in and out of existence every billionth of a billionth of a nanc filling the vacuum with enormous amounts of ambient Quantum energy with this estimate a coffee cup of empty space would have enough energy to blow up an entire planet and not just once more than a 100 million times wiping out every planet in the galaxy but again why stop there the collisions in the tunnel at CERN are at the edge of experimental physics as it is today but that is only limited by our technology and of course funding there's no no real reason to believe that physics could not go beyond this point with better machines we could imagine peering even more deeply into the Micro World resolving the Universe on an even smaller scale so how far could we go well we could imagine breaking the universe up into pieces as small as the plank length which is more than a million billion times smaller than the scale of our experiments at CERN the plank length is the distance at which the fabric of space and time ceases to make sense as it becomes overwhelmed by Quantum effects if we tried to break the universe up into pieces smaller than the plank length the very notion of space and time would begin to disintegrate but tiny little boxes of Plank and size are more than enough to worry about if we break the universe up into pieces this small we find that our coffee cup of empty space would contain a Google gigles of energy and that is enough to blow up every planet and St star in the observable universe again and again and again more than a trillion trillion trillion trillion times so should we be worried should it terrify us to learn that empty space must contain such gargantuan energies lurking all around us between the molecules of air even in the empty space between the atoms in your body in a world without gravity there's nothing to fear for this null Punk's energy is constant the energy density of empty space is the same everywhere that's why we sometimes call it the cosmological constant to create weapons that destroy planets and galaxies you need energy differences gradients in the energy density that allow you to generate a force the true underlying vacuum energy of of our entire universe has constant density across all of space there are no gradients you couldn't use it to crush a grape never mind a Galaxy without gravity this vacuum energy cannot touch you but with gravity that's a very different story with gravity the vacuum energy Goes [Music] Wild to understand this we need to understand how gravity Works Einstein taught us that the gravitational force is very different to the other fundamental forces in nature in some senses it's not really a force at all gravity is really the shape of SpaceTime and so it isn't just mass that bends space and time mass is just a form of energy all energy bends the space and time around it creating the Warped shapes in SpaceTime that we perceive as Gravity the null puns energy is no exception the vacuum energy the cosmological constant whatever you want to call it will bend the shape of space and time even if it is the same everywhere and of course the more of this energy you have the more space time should be bent this is why poy declared that the Universe would not even reach the moon e calculated the density of the energy in empty space and worked out how much that would bend SpaceTime quickly seeing that SpaceTime would be bent right back so that the observable realm could not even reach as far as the moon but we've already seen how poy had underestimated the vacuum energy guided as he was by the limits of experimental physics in his day modern estimates suggest that the Universe would contain so much energy in empty space it would be bent into Oblivion crushed under its own weight it wouldn't even reach beyond the end of your nose never mind the moon and now we have to State the obvious the universe does reach beyond the end of your nose in fact it reaches a billion trillion times farther than the moon the edge of the observable universe as we've seen is around 462 billion light years away if the cosmological constant is there it's a whole lot smaller than we expected in fact it should be more than a Google time smaller the energy stored in a coffee cup of empty space cannot be enough to destroy a planet or Star it shouldn't even be enough to crush the smallest insect in the world this is the cosmological constant problem our best and most trusted theories of fundamental physics come together to predict that our universe should be so overwhelmed by the nul pun eni by a terrifyingly large cosmological constant that it simply shouldn't exist and yet it does [Music] why on the 3rd of September 1949 a filter paper on a weather plane flying from Japan to Alaska detected unusually high levels of radioactivity the filter paper was sent to the US scientific Lab at Los Alamos for further analysis and on the 23rd of September US president Harry S Truman announced that the Soviet Union had successfully detonated an atomic device the bomb had been detonated a few days prior to the Flight of the weather plane at 7:00 a.m. local time on August the 29th at the semipalatinsk test site in modernday Kazakhstan 10 km south of Ground Zero were eight men amongst them Yakov zeldovich head of the theory division at the Soviet nuclear Development Center at aramas 16 zeldovich remembered seeing a bright cone-shaped flash with a tongue of Fire coming out of the dust and smoke before stepping down into the safety trench after 30 seconds the sound of the explosion reached the trench like a clap of Thunder some of the men celebrated in Praise of comrad Stalin zeldovich stayed silent to the Soviets zeldovich was a silent Superstar a legendary physicist who played a pivotal role in their nuclear weapons program and one of only 16 people to have been named a hero of socialist labor on three separate occasions whereas Robert Oppenheimer became less active in physics after his involvement in developing the nuclear bomb zeldovich went on to make major contributions to particle physics astronomy and cosmology and it was zeldovich 20 years later in 1967 and 1968 who made made the world take notice of the cosmological constant problem it's not clear if zeldovich knew about Po and his enigmatic calculation in the cafe in Hamburg in the mid 1920s but it didn't matter zeldovich was armed with far more powerful tools than poy ever had at his disposal by the late 60s the general theory of relativity was well established along with its applications to cosmology Quantum field theory was fast becoming the dominant description for a subatomic world it was really zeldovich who saw that the vacuum ought to be a bubbling broth of virtual particles endlessly popping in and out of existence weighing down the vacuum bending the universe back into Oblivion zeldovich knew that something had to be wrong with our understanding of the universe and sensed an opportunity for physics stating that the clarification of the cosmological constant will be of tremendous fundamental significance for the theory of Elementary particles so what can we do about this cosmological constant problem perhaps we should just take an empirical approach the energy of empty space is whatever we measure it to be if it's small it's small who cares about zeld doich and the predictions of quantum field Theory who cares about poy and his idiosyncratic Cafe calculations perhaps that's just not how nature chose to do things but this is not very satisfying the quest is to discover How the Universe works and a wealth of empirical data points towards a Micro World accurately described by Quantum field Theory the relativistic version of quantum mechanics developed in the Years following the second world war we can't just simply abandon it not after so much experimental success elsewhere and then there is the general theory theory of relativity the Zenith of Einstein's genius describing gravity as the shape of SpaceTime accurately predicting exotic phenomena like the bending of light around the sun and the perah helian procession of the planet Mercury a slow but Relentless shift in its elliptical orbit it too has a huge wealth of data supporting it even being added to to this day ligo's detection of gravitational waves in 2015 another feather in its cap but together these two two great pillars of 20th century physics predict a universe instantly destroyed by the overwhelming weight of the vacuum by a Herculean cosmological constant by the nul punk eni as zeldovich realized more than 50 years ago we are obviously misunderstanding something something very important the cosmological constant problem is such a crisis in our understanding of fundamental physics its resolution is expected to lead to something profound a step change in our picture of how the universe really works another example of something similar is the famous black hole information Paradox another problem that zeldovich had a hand in this is the question of what happens to all the information you throw into a black hole does it disappear in violation of the laws of quantum mechanics or does it survive and if so where does it go just like the solution to the cosmological constant problem the answers to these questions are expected to reveal something deep about the fundamental fabric of our physical world and so theoretical physicists are forever looking for the solution to the cosmological constant problem in the half century since zeldovich formulated the problem in modern terms many solutions have come but many have also gone a Common Thread is a assuming that zelich's calculation of the cosmological constant is only part of the story that the elementary particles contribute an overwhelmingly large vacuum energy but that there is another piece another constant from some hitherto hidden sector of the microw world that cancels out the parts that zel doich found how and why it would be able to cancel them out to such an astonishing level of precision is the key piece of the puzzle it's like balancing the weight of a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion Suns accurate to the mass of a single electron the most popular idea makes use of the Multiverse the idea that our observable universe is just one of many possible universes each with a different value for the overall cosmological constant and perhaps other fundamental constants in most parts of this theoretical Multiverse the scales are off balance and the overall cosmological constant is large and overwhelming but in some rare corners of the Multiverse the balancing works and the overall cosmological constant is small just like it is in our universe String Theory our most promising candidate for a Theory of Everything predicts that such a Multiverse could exist it has all the right sort of hidden sectors with a multitude of different possibilities depending on who you ask string theory predicts between 10 to the power of 500 and 10 to the power of 272,000 different vacua different universes with range of vacuum energies a spectrum of cosmological constants this Multiverse is known as the string theory landscape and it's just what we would need to take on the cosmological constant problem with an Innovative but controversial idea but if small cosmological constants are rare in this possible Multiverse how come we find ourselves in a universe with a tiny cosmological constant this is where some physicists Advocate the anthropic principle the idea is that those universes with a large and overwhelming cosmological constant are uninhabitable because of the enormous weight of empty space if the cosmological constant is too large and positive the universe is blasted apart too quickly so much so that matter is unable to Clump together and stars and planets never get the chance to form if the cosmological constant is too large and negative the expansion of the universe rapidly gives way to an apocalyptic crunch a universe squashed out of existence again before stars and planets ever get to form it is only in these rare universes like ours where the cosmological constant is unexpectedly small the conditions are just right a goldilux universe with a slow and gentle Cosmic Evolution allowing time for stars and planets to form and providing a home home for complex life indeed it is only in these goldilock worlds that someone or something like poy or zeldovich can eventually be born smart enough to ask difficult questions about the cosmological constant about the energy of empty space but not Everyone likes this explanation some people say that the Multiverse and anthropic selection is unscientific that it cannot be falsified although that is not entirely true back in 1997 Nobel laurat Steven Weinberg and his collaborators argued that if the vacuum energy was less than 60% of the total energy budget of the universe anthropic arguments could not explain why it was so small this was a testable prediction of the anthropic solution to the cosmological constant problem and as it happened less than a year later astronomers announced the discovery of dark energy making up around 70% of all the energy in the observable universe the anthropic principle had passed its first test but people are still searching for alternative ideas that don't rely on anthropic reasoning these ideas go by many names super symmetric large extra Dimensions vacuum energy sequestering pan Cosmic relativity to name but a few however the is no consensus and right now the mystery of the cosmological constant remains unsolved and so we set out to weigh the universe and stumbled across one of the most embarrassing problems in fundamental physics we wait the stars and the planets and clouds of interstellar gas we wait the Halos of dark matter that shroud our galaxies and we weighed the vacuum of empty space and it weighed so little where was the weight of the bubbling broth of virtual particles frantically popping in

[Music] in the 1970s astronomers discovered that our Milky Way galaxy is moving drawn by great invisible forces we were being pulled towards something but we couldn't see what a final destination was hidden by the zone of avoidance a region of the sky obscured by the gas and dust of the galactic dis like a tiny rra to drift in a vast ocean on a moonless night we were caught up in the current heading towards who knows where and we weren't alone for it wasn't just the Milky Way that was in motion but all of our neighbors two astronomers arand Tully and J Richard Fischer were using the parks radio telescope in Australia to conduct a survey of distant galaxies attempting with their meager observations to reconstruct their movements and around the same time multiple teams of astronomers were observing the cosmic microwave background the bath of radiation that survives as a relic from the early days of the big bang and independently both groups found the first hints of this great Cosmic [Music] flow the galaxies that tul and Fisher mapped seem to share a common Locus they reconstructed velocities all roughly pointing in the same direction as for the cosmic microwave background its temperature across the sky revealed a bias it was slightly hotter in One Direction and slightly cooler in the other much of this discrepancy could be eliminated by considering the motion of the sun around the core of the Milky Way But even after that subtraction a residue remained an unexplained source of motion relative to the ultimate Cosmic reference frame a speed amounting to hundreds of kilometers per second it appeared as if the Milky Way and all the other galaxies in our nearby vicinity of the Cosmos were being drawn to a particular spot a specific location in the universe as if Tied by great invisible chains stretching tens of millions of light years we couldn't see it couldn't map it couldn't figure out what it was for decades the best we could do was simply name it the great attractor a great source of inexorable motion a persistent sink of gravity a single point in the course Mor that pulls and pulls and pulls our entire galaxy and thousands of others home to hundreds of billions of stars and countless planets drawn to the great attractor like helpless moths to a flame and yet no matter how odd this may seem this is not an unusual situation in the cosmos for the universe is far from static every object within the universe is in a state of restless motion from the orbit of the Earth around the Sun to the sun's drift within our galaxy to the hurtling of the Milky Way towards the greater tractor and that's not even the largest example in the universe for the greater tractor turned out to be just the tip of a far grander Cosmic Iceberg flowing across the sky vast Cosmic structures and motions dwarfing anything we had ever seen before and so nothing is still everything is going somewhere the question is where on the 23rd of September 1999 the Mars climate Orbiter lost contact with NASA as it approached the planet the mission was totally lost and it later turned out to have been down to a mistake converting metric to Imperial units even

supporting educational content on YouTube our universe is defined by motion and one way to describe the history of science is through our increasing awareness of the restlessness of the cosmos for Millennia the brightest scientific Minds in Europe and the Middle East believed that the Earth was perfectly still and that the heavens revolved around it those early astronomers busied themselves with attempts to explain and predict the motion of other objects the Sun the moon each of the known planets and the stars and their predictions worked surprisingly well but their cosmological system of motion wasn't perfect in fact it was an ungainly mathematical mess relying on small circular orbits nested within larger ones with some centered on the earth and some centered on other points and so on his deathbed in 1543 the Polish astronomer Nicolas kernus published on the Revolutions of the Heavenly spheres a radical reformulation of the old system that put the Sun at the center of the universe still and motionless with the Earth set in motion around it along with all the other planets reaction to the work of Cernic's was mixed on one hand it was a bold reshaping of the universe on the other it was arguably just as messy as the ancient system it was trying to replace and on top of this it introduced more than a few questions that had no easy answers first and foremost if the Earth was moving how could we tell we know we are moving on the surface of the Earth through a variety of ways we can feel the wind against our face when we run or watch as a distant goal draws nearer so why don't we feel a great Rush of wind as the Earth orbits around the Sun or why aren't we flung off into the void of space due to the incredible rotation of our planet it took centuries of Science and the development of Isaac newson's theory of gravity for the full picture to come together today we know that we don't feel the motion of the Earth because we are in motion along with it and since the vacuum of space is just that a vacuum there's nothing for us to push against and betray that motion and so how can we guarantee the that the Earth truly is in motion is there a standard reference indeed Newton assumed that such a standard existed that there was a fixed frame of universal reference from which all motion could be measured in crafting relativity Einstein rejected the concept of a fixed Universal ruler against which we could judge all motion instead all inertial motion was relative the only way to measure motion is in reference to something else and from this fundamental idea the rest of Relativity blossoms the fabric of SpaceTime the equivalence of mass and energy the limitations of the speed of light all of it imagine cruising in an unpowered rocket ship and encountering your friend doing the same in the opposite direction you are both in an inertial frame of reference moving at a fixed speed a you cross paths you may declare that you are moving and they are staying put but in relativity they have just as equal right to state that they are moving and you are the one that is standing still these two perspectives are equally valid despite this we can tell that the Earth is spinning because of the coris force which twists airst streams around to form hurricanes and typhoons and so even if our skies were completely blank with not a single star to be seen in the sky with nothing left to measure except what we have right in front of us we could still deduce the motion of the rotation of the Earth but the movement of the earth throughout the greater universe is another matter Al together for that we need to identify some other frame of reference some other yard stick for us to measure from otherwise we could rightfully claim just like any other object in the universe that we are motionless and that the rest of the cosmos every planet and star and Galaxy moves around and about us and thankfully the universe itself gives us exactly the tools we need the trick is that we don't live in a static universe but an expanding one the cosmos changes from day to day in the past it was smaller and in the future it will be larger and it is this that allows us to write down a preferred frame of reference one that expands along with the universe allowing us to measure motion relative to that in other words at large scales the universe is expanding on average galaxies are getting farther away from each other with time we can then Define motion on top of that General expansion anything that deviates from the general outward flow of the universe is special and unique in the Palance of cosmology this is known as peculiar velocity and these velocities can range from a few hundred to a few thousand km/s and armed with this mathematical toolkit cosmologists can begin to understand not just the rotation of the Earth or the orbit of our planet around the Sun but the movement of our solar system within the Galaxy and the action of the Milky Way within the wider universe and so without even feeling it without even taking a single step you will move an incredible distance through your life first there is the rotation of the earth depending on where you sit on the globe you could be whipping around at up to, 1600 km every hour of course if you happen to be standing on either geographic pole your rotational velocity will be exactly zero for most of humanity which lives somewhere in the mid latitudes between the poles in the Equator the typical everyday velocity is around 1,000 kmph for typical human lifetime time of around 80 years or 700,000 hours that gives a lifetime movement of around a billion kilomet just due to the rotation of the Earth but the Earth is also orbiting the Sun with an average speed of 30 km/ second over your lifetime that adds up to around another 80 billion kilm of total movement though of course most of that is in a rough Circle so it's not like you're going anywhere with it and the orbit of the earth is not the end of our motion the Sun along with all the planets asteroids comets and all the other denisons of the solar system moves within the Milky Way most of that motion is a simple orbit around the galactic center a journey that takes 230 million years to complete a single Revolution but in that time the sun travels an enormous distance giving it an average speed of around 230 km per second and interestingly that number is also profound evidence for the existence of dark matter within the Milky Way when we add up the mass of all the Luminous objects within the orbit of the sun even including generous allowances for all the stars and clumps of gas that we can't directly observe there still isn't nearly enough material to keep the sun in a steady orbit if there was no additional source of mass the sun's current speed should have assured that it would have been completely ejected from the Milky Way billions of years ago but yet the Sun is still here still orbiting trained to the Milky Way by some invisible form of matter dark matter that lends its weight to the Galaxy and glues everything together in addition to its orbit around the center The Sun Also lazily Bobs up and down like a boy in a dark ocean a byproduct of the unstable gravitational influences of all its neighbors over the course of millions of years the sun rises thousands of light years above the galactic plane before plunging through it reaching a minimum and starting the cycle a new currently the sun is plunging through a region known as the local bubble a cavity blown out of the interstellar medium by a supernova detonation that went off millions of years ago this bubble has a density less than 1/10th the average for the Milky Way which is already low enough that it would register as a vacuum in a laboratory on Earth our solar system entered the bubbles somewhere between 5 and 10 million years ago and will continue to cross its thousand ligher expanse for millions of years to come and yet that is far from the end of it for against the backdrop of the expansion of the universe our galaxy is also on the move and it's headed right for our nearest neighbor [Music] billions of years from now our Sky will be unrecognizable the moon will be smaller fainter and more distant the sun will be larger and brighter all the familiar constellations will be gone replaced with a new generation of stars in our Solar neighborhood and in that nighttime sky One Singular object will reign supreme greater in Majesty than any nebula star or Planet the Andromeda galaxy right now Andromeda is large but not noticeably so taking up as much of the sky is a fist held at arms length within 2 and A2 billion years however Andromeda will dominate our Knights almost completely filling the sky and it will not look like the Andromeda that we know today in the far future it will be distorted its previously simple shape Twisted by tremendous forces of gravity as it begins to tangle with the Milky Way a billion years after that the sky filling Andromeda will be Ablaze with giant stars as the gravitational interactions between the two galaxies will ignite a new round of star formation and it will be billions of years after that long after our sun has breathed its last that the merger process between Andromeda and the Milky Way will end the core of this new Galaxy will glow with ghostly prominence in the sky brighter than any other nighttime object if our planet survives huddled against the meager glow of our Sun's white dwarf we will see the sky slowly fade first into redness and then finally as the last of the visible stars disappear into Blackness it was in the 1920s that Edwin Hubble made the remarkable discovery that the Andromeda nebula which had long befuddled astronomers was actually an island Universe in its own right an entire galaxy sitting 2 and 1 half million Li years away over 10 times more distant than the furthest object astronomers had hypothesized could exist but measuring the speed of Andromeda was not a straightforward exercise Andromeda is simply too big training a telescope on it only revealed a small portion with wildly different velocity measurements and so it took until 1957 for the Dutch astronomer Henrik Vander hulst to finally provide a robust number he examined the faint radiation emitted by neutral hydrogen something known as 21 cm radiation with careful radio measurements astronomers like Vander hulst could build up crude maps of the feeble signal sent out by this neutral hydrogen and examine any shifts in its Spectrum a red shift from the expected wavelength would indicate movement away from us while a blue shift would signal motion towards us and it was via this method that Vander Holst arrived at an average speed of Min - 296 km/s with an uncertainty of around 10 km a clear indication that andrometer is moving towards us but to further complicate matters that measurement didn't just include the motion of our galaxies moving together but also the movement of the sun around the galactic center that must be subtracted to get give the true Galactic motion and that number is right around 100 km/s but of course now that we know the number there is freedom to choose the frame of reference we could say that the Milky Way is still and that Andromeda is racing towards us or that the Milky Way is rushing towards it at a great speed but in the frame of reference that respects the expansion of the universe our two galaxies are actually both moving towards each other heading towards a common gravitational Center but this motion didn't necessarily mean that we would definitely Collide astronomers can typically only measure the radial motion of a galaxy the component of its velocity that is pointing either towards us or away from us lateral or side to side motion is much more difficult to measure indeed it wasn't until 2012 when a team of astronomers led by sangos used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the velocities of thousands of Stars within Andromeda that we had our first clear picture of its true three-dimensional course and it was then that we realized we really were on a collision course the fun begins in as little as 2 billion years as our galaxies draw closer their immense gravitational interactions will begin to distort and reshape them the cause is the same physics that governs the ocean tides on the Earth Earth the parts of each Galaxy that are nearest to each other will receive a stronger gravitational pull than the rest while the parts on the opposite sides will receive the weakest gravitational pole this causes a tidal force that will stretch each Galaxy sometimes entire spiral arms can detach from a Galaxy causing a phenomenon known as a tidal tail an expanse of intense star formation stretching tens of thousands of light years and between the galaxies a bridge of gas and stars often develops as if the galaxies are reaching for each other but when the merger event finally happens in roughly 5 billion years it will not be like a sudden car crash most of the volume of each Galaxy is nearly empty space consisting of nothing more than a thin spread of plasma stretched between the Stars while the gas Tangles up on itself forming shock fronts and complex waves of disturbances the Stars simply pass by each other like two giant swarms of bees but that doesn't mean that the Stars will go unharmed in the midst of a galaxy merger Stars will come dangerously close to each other not enough to pair off and merge together but more than close enough to disrupt their orbits in short everything will become chaos the flat plane of the galactic discs replaced with a tangled mass of complex overlapping orbits most stars will survive in this new reality but some will be scattered Ed receiving boosts of energy from nearby encounters flung away from their Galactic homes forever the first merger pass will take more than 100 million years to complete and will repeat several times over a few hundred million years with each cycle of collision interaction and separation growing progressively shorter indeed each one of these interactions will lead to a fresh round of star formation as gas compresses and fragments at its peak the star formation process in the merged Galaxy could reach over a thousand times its present day rate and so for a brief moment it will be beautiful the merged Galaxy adorned with millions of newborn Stars blazing bright white and blue a dazzling release of the Titanic energies that powered the Collision but then sadly comes the tragic end Galaxies have only limited supply of gas to turn into new generations of stars left alone a Galaxy like the Milky Way can steadily sip on its reserves for over a 100 billion years but the act of the Collision Burns far too hot quickly depleting Reservoir after reservoir of gas in the intense rounds of star formation once those Stars burn out there will be relatively little left to form new ones and the only remaining Stars within the Galaxy will be the longlived dwarf stars small and dim and red the merged Galaxy some astronomers call it mil comoda will become a giant elliptical a large red ooid incapable of substantial star formation and doomed to Simply pass the days watching its population of stars drop one by one of course this is all hypothetical our best guess as to how this massive event will unfold and some of the most recent simulations have raised the possibility that it may not happen for another 8 billion years if at all astronomers can't watch Galaxy mergers play out in real time as the process takes hundreds of millions of years to complete instead what we have are snapshots the beginning of a merger here or the end result there a kaleidoscope of catastrophes caught in this specific moment in time take the m galaxies a pair of interacting galaxies sitting 290 million light years away so named because their long tiddled Tales make them look like two mice nestled together the Galaxies have just begun the merger process and the ensuing gravitational distortions and in 2023 astronomers used the James web Space Telescope to observe ARP 220 a pair of galaxies caught mid merger sitting 250 million light years away the merger triggered a round of star formation so intense that the Galaxy now shines over a 100 times brighter than the Milky Way But already star formation has shut off what we are currently seeing is the Afterglow of the already ignited Stars throughout the Universe astronomers see countless galaxies interacting in a variety of different ways there are galaxies colliding headon and others just glancing by each other sometimes they are perpendicular and sometimes they are slamming their spiral arms against each other sometimes more than two are caught in a struggle for gravitational dominance and so the process of Galaxy merges began billions of years ago even before the galaxies themselves arose and it will continue long into the future for the Journey of the Milky Way does not end in its merger with Andromeda our motion through the universe is far from over and it's towards a direction that we barely [Music] understand sometimes mathematics can be a crystal ball that lets the careful Observer peer through the distant reaches of space and time and sometimes that crystal ball begins its own story in a space and time far far removed from Modern Day cosmology take the wide reaching consequences of the work of the French mathematician Gaspar MJ although he didn't know it at the time instead as minister of the Navy in Revolutionary France in 1792 he was more interested in working out optimization problems in the transportation of goods several decades later the great Pioneer Andre Marie on took M's work and expanded on it generating an equation that has since found use in a variety of economic settings for example in figuring out the most efficient way to move resources between mines and factories and in the midst of World War II the Soviet mathematician Leonard canovic took the work of M andare to the next level extending and applying their equations to the thorny logistical problems faced by the Soviet War Machine but finally in a beautiful example of the universality of physics in the 1970s Canadian American cosmologist Jim Peebles realized that the same equations could be used to describe the efficient movement of mass in the assembly and formation of galaxies coming from a humble background the son of a Grain Exchange worker and a homemaker Jim would go on to study at Princeton University and eventually become a giant in the field of cosmology though in the early days of his research in the 1960s cosmology was not widely considered a serious field of study we knew that the Universe was expanding and that the Big Bang picture was likely correct but there was so little observational data available that most astronomers considered the field a dead end with no serious future but Jim pushed on and pioneered almost every aspect of modern physical cosmology from the growth of structure to the earliest moments of the Big Bang work that would earn him a Nobel Prize in physics in 2019 and completing the circle it was two astronomers the French Roya mahay and the Russian Andre seski who followed up on Jim's pioneering work and finally turned the so-called M jeon canovic equations into a cosmological crystal ball they found that they could take the present day positions of galaxies and combine that with limited information on their velocities to transport these galaxies back in time the trick behind this approach is that we know how galaxies move they're influenced by their Mutual gravitational attraction and we know how gravity works so this technique allows cosmologists to take the current state of a collection of galaxies and compute where they should have been in the past it's not perfect by any means every step backwards in time introduces ever larger uncertainties and the technique can't go all the way back to the Big Bang but it does work with this method Brent Tully who first identified the beginnings of the great ATT tractor and his collaborators have released continuously updated cataloges called Cosmic flows which map out tens of thousands of galaxies around the Milky Way along with their positions billions of years ago this information allows him and his colleagues to reconstruct the Motions of galaxies through Cosmic time not just into the past but into the future giving them the ability to predict where the Milky Way is headed and it's through this technique a combination of intense careful observations and clever mathematical crystal balls that we can finally understand the shape and influence of the great attractor and what our ultimate fate in the universe will be the expansion of the universe allows us to construct a preferred frame of reference from which we can judge all motion its movement relative to the general expansion flow we can therefore create detailed velocity maps of nearby galaxies to attempt to ascertain that General flow a laborious and eraone exercise however thankfully the universe itself gives us a snapshot of that cosmological reference frame for confirmation of the great ATT tractor's existence came not from maps of local galaxies but from the ultimate source of light in the entire universe the cosmic microwave background the CMB was generated when the universe was roughly 380,000 years old when the transition from a hot dense plasma into a slightly less hot but neutral gas flooded the cosmos with radiation that radiation has two very useful properties one it's literally everywhere every single cubic centimeter of space participated in the creation of the CMB and the formation of the CMB was relatively brief on the order of 10,000 years so the CMB is responsible for the vast majority of photons in the universe and we can see it in all directions in the sky everywhere you go in the universe you'll always see the CMB and secondly the CMB is almost perfectly uniform with deviations in temperature no bigger than roughly one part in a million a reflection of the nearly pure homogeneity of the early Universe this means that we are surrounded on all sides by radiation that is almost perfectly smooth and was created in a single moment in the distant past it is a measurable snapshot of the cosmological reference frame any movement within the universe relative to that frame will distort our image of the CMB it would appear blue shifted in our direction of motion and red shifted away from our direction of motion and that's exactly what we [Music] observe the cmbb is hotter by about 0.0035 5 Kelvin in the direction of the constellation Leo and CER by that same amount in the direction of the constellation Aquarius the only way to explain this temperature discrepancy known as a dipole is by our motion relative to the CNB and hence cosmical frame of reference to get this measured shifting our speed must be somewhere around 600 km per second of course some portion of that velocity is due to the sun's orbit around the center of the Milky Way and some is due to our inevitable collision with Andromeda but even after subtracting that there's still a residue about 300 km/s and the direction of that movement after accounting for the orbit of the sun and the merger path of the Milky Way is straight towards the great attractor the grand structures of our universe a built from billions of years of restless ceaseless motion the Milky Way started out small just a few thousand stars huddled together in the dark but it was birthed in movement and through successive mergers amassed itself to its present day status this same story has played out trillions of times across the visible Universe creating Galaxy after Galaxy this is the story of hierarchical structure formation how our universe built itself like a towering Lego Masterpiece Brick by solitary brick and and so there are hierarchies of structure in the universe galaxies groups clusters and superclusters and along with that hierarchy of structure comes a hierarchy of movement the galaxies already assembled from countless merges in the past groups like The Local group that contains the Milky Way Andromeda triangulum and a host of smaller dwarf galaxies are still in the process of collapse and merger indeed roughly 100 billion years after the Milky Way and Andromeda meet each other the other members of the local group will collapse in with them forming a single Mega Galaxy these groups of galaxies like the local group are in motion as well trekking along through the expanses of the universe towards their local centers of gravitational attraction the clusters of galaxies the nearest cluster to us is the Virgo cluster already home to thousands of galaxies and drawing tens of thousands more towards it in addition to the motion of the Milky Way towards Andromeda as a group we are also Falling Towards Virgo this process was set in motion during the earliest moments of the Big Bang but only ramped up a few billion years ago as clusters like Virgo grew they exerted more gravitational influence on their surroundings this pulled more material onto them which increased their mass and increased their gravity long ago the nent Virgo cluster started weakly tugging on the local group and as the cluster grew that gentle tug turned into a mighty force and this growth through gravity does not just stop at the scale of clusters though clusters are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe for the Clusters themselves participate in yet another level of growth one that is not quite finished the building of superclusters superclusters have always had a loose definition in astronomy usually referring to anything vaguely resembling a coherent structure on scales larger than clusters as far back as 1863 astronomers William and John hersel noted an excess number of nebula which were really galaxies in the direction of the Virgo cluster in the 1950s the astronomer Gerard deer tentatively identified this excess of galaxies as a structure in its own right calling it The Local Super Galaxy which he later changed to local supercluster but because superclusters are not yet fully assembled they have no easily defined limits or boundaries initially astronomers believed that the Virgo cluster sat at the heart of the local super cluster also confusingly known as the Virgo super cluster a rough collection of around 100 Galaxy groups and individual clusters spanning over 100 million light years in breadth but beginning in 2014 Brent Tully along with collaborators elen ctoa Yehuda Hoffman and Daniel pomed proposed a new definition of supercluster this definition was not based on spatial extent but on movement they employed the Monon canovic reconstruction technique to Spring their Galaxy surveys into life changing them from static snapshots of the present day Universe into living entities enabling them to see where these tens of thousands of galaxies near to us came from and discern where they're going and it was the Motions of these galaxies that revealed the true extent of our local supercluster it turned out what we thought was a supercluster was just a single Branch one of four of a much larger assemblage an entity that Tully and his collaborators named lania a Hawaiian word that roughly translates to immense heaven or open Skies [Music] and so the Milky Way galaxy belongs to the local group because we are all moving towards a Common Center which would eventually become a gigantic singular Galaxy the local group belongs to the Virgo branch of our supercluster because we are all headed towards the Virgo cluster and the Virgo supercluster Branch belongs to Lan AA because we're all moving towards the center of Lan AA 100,000 galaxies in total spanning across over 500 100 million Li years in length assembled on four separate branches each one considered superclusters in their own right all headed for a single destination the Beating Heart of lanaka the local Center of Attraction of this portion of the universe the final assembly point of a construction process that began billions of years ago and will take hundreds of billions of years to complete the center of it all the greater tractor our portrait of the greater tractor is hazy at best because it lies within the zone of avoidance the direction in the universe obscured by our own Galaxy's dust but some wavelengths of light can penetrate that dust and surveys taken with radio infrared and x-ray have shown us glimpses of what lies Beyond the Veil and what might be sitting within the greater tractor's region as best we can tell the heart of lanaka the focal point for the great migration of 100,000 galaxies including the Milky Way is the Norma cluster named for the constellation we must peer through to see it it is several times larger than a typical Galaxy cluster and sits about 220 million Li years away from us and so even at a speed of over 100 km/s the normal cluster is so far away that our journey towards it would take over a 100 billion years Norma began life just like any other Galaxy cluster the result of countless merges and Relentless gravitational attraction but it happened to sit at the bottom of an immense gravitational well the single point of Attraction for this entire local region of the universe indeed over time noral will only grow more immense as it continues to collect more material within it but recent surveys again using the M Jean canovic reconstruction technique have revealed that our motion towards the greater tractor that is the Norma cluster is still not the end of the story for one even though our understanding of Norma is vague at best it appears to be a little too small even adding in the contribution of its Dark Matter Norma's gravitational pull is not quite large enough to account for the speed with which we are moving towards the great ATT tractor in other words the great ATT tractor isn't quite as great as it initially appears there seems to be an additional source of Attraction sitting even further beyond the Norma cluster for Norma 2 appears to be in motion an entity even larger even greater than the greater tractor sitting over 650 million light years away the structure was first observed by harlo shapley of the Harvard College observatory in 1930 who could only dimly perceive a distant nebulosity but we now know it to be another supercluster the next nearest neighbor to our own lanaka and from what we can tell it's a supercluster even larger than our own the incredible mass of the shapley supercluster is influencing every Galaxy every group and every cluster around it for hundreds of millions of light years indeed if we were to give the universe enough time and for all this motion to continue unabated the Lano would transform into a single compact object a much more immense version of the normal cluster that currently sits at its heart and that object would eventually make its way to a similar one situated at the center of the shapley supercluster and there are even hints of additional motion on even greater scales in 2008 NASA astronomer Alexander kashlinsky was observing a subtle signal found in the cosmic microwave background known as the kinematic siav zeldovich effect it's a tiny imprint caused when light from the CMB passes through a Galaxy cluster on its way towards us by comparing these signals in different regions of the sky kashlinsky found that there appeared to be a large flow of clusters towards a direction on our Sky between the constellation curus and V this apparent dark flow as kashlinsky nicknamed it was between 600 and 1,000 km/s faster than our own motion towards the great ATT tractor and that motion caught up a significant portion of clusters in the universe and the Intriguing puzzle with this dark flow is that the differences in density in the universe aren't large enough to explain the velocity there simply isn't enough material collected together in any one patch of the universe to explain such large scale Co erent motion although in 2013 scientists with the esa's plank satellite found no evidence for dark flow debate continues whether this dark flow is a real feature of our Cosmos or not there are still reverberations echoing from the distant past when the universe was only a few hundred thousand years old it was over aill million times smaller than it is today and all its material was compressed into a hot dense plasma like any plasma sound waves crashed and echoed within it as waves of density surged back and forth and these sound waves have a name bionic acoustic oscillations when the universe expanded and cooled it transitioned from a plasma to a neutral gas releasing the cosmic microwave background and at that moment the bionic acoustic oscillations were frozen in place trapped in whatever position and state they were in when the plasma dissipated these oscillations persisted as Tiny fluctuations in density a series of overlapping shells of slightly higher density than their surroundings over time along with the rest of the universe they grew accumulating more matter than average and after hundreds of millions of years more galaxies than average and today cosm ologists map the imprint of the acoustic oscillations in massive surveys of galaxies using them to test models of the history of the universe and in 2023 Brent Tully Colin howlet and Daniel pomed discovered that many nearby clusters walls and other structures of the cosmic web are arranged in the shape of a shell the radius of this shell is over 400 million light years and it includes elements like the SLO Great Wall this CFA Great Wall and the Hercules complex all centered on the booti supercluster all enormous entities in their own right Tully and his collaborators believe that this structure is an individual bionic acoustic oscillation a remnant of the chaotic plasma era of the universe still echoing today appropriately enough they named it h Lana taken from a portion of a Hawaiian creation chant meaning from Deep Darkness came murmurs of [Music] Awakening and finally reverberations of Ages past are not the only forces at play in the Deep Universe we are constantly pulled by gravity the gravity of Andromeda the gravity of the Virgo cluster the gravity of the great attractor the gravity of the shapley super cluster the gravity of H Lana but there are also pushes sources not of Attraction but of repulsion adding up all the known sources of mass in The Wider universe as deep and as far as our galaxy surveys will reveal to us is still not enough to fully account for the motion of the Milky Way galaxy there appears to be something else something on the opposite side of the sky of the shapley supercluster something that we have not yet fully met or understood a great void a vast expanse of nothingness one of many that dominate the volume of the universe named the dipole repell void we did not yet have an accurate understanding of its shape size or Dimensions all we know is that it seems to participate in the great movements that Define life in the large scale universe and the important thing to realize here is that these great voids don't just let go of matter they actively push away the galaxies at their edges because despite their emptiness they are filled to the brim with dark [Music] energy and eventually the repulsion of these voids will unwind the cosmic clock unravel the cosmic web and prevent us from ever reaching the great attractor [Music] it was perhaps the only time that Einstein didn't trust his own mathematics early in his career he had made a name for himself with his leaps of imagination and insight grounded in a deep understanding of the physical universe and the mathematics needed to bring his ideas to light indeed in a single year he crafted the special theory of relativity discovered a foundational principle of quantum mechanics and conclusively demonstrated the existence of atoms but in 1917 Einstein tripped over himself he had just developed general relativity and found numerous applications for it and so decided to take these new found equations and use them to describe the entire universe after all gravity is the only force that operates at large scales across all objects and so the language of general relativity should have been more than capable of describing the evolution of the cosmos yet what he found surprised him his equations naturally predicted a dynamic Universe one that was always in motion with all objects at large scales either collapsing together or expanding away from each other this went against the conventional wisdom at the time that while planets May orbit and stars may move here and there the large scale unit Universe was fixed and static for all eternity and so for whatever reason Einstein didn't want to disrupt the established order and he found an opportunity in the form of a cosmological constant a number that he could slip into his equations without breaking them in the solar system this cosmological constant didn't affect any measurements but on large scales it would act to stabilize the universe overcoming the natural tendency of objects in the COS Moss to [Music] move unfortunately for this idea just a few years later Edwin Hubble would discover the expansion of the universe while Einstein never admitted it in public or in any letter his closest friends recalled that he would refer to the cosmological constant as his greatest blunder yet despite Einstein's regret the constant never quite went away eventually the great Soviet astrophysicist Yakov zeldovich recognized its importance when he equated the cosmological constant to the vacuum energy of SpaceTime just two different expressions of the same fundamental concept and in 1998 astronomers realized that the expansion of the universe was accelerating the most likely culprit for this mysterious accelerated expansion the vacuum energy of space time and so in the span of only a few weeks cosmologists around the world dusted off their history books and reacquainted themselves with Einstein's greatest blunder and how that little innocent term in the equations just might be tearing the universe [Music] apart the local group the Virgo cluster the lanaka super cluster they were all built atom by atom Galaxy by Galaxy they took billions of years of slow and steady movement to reach their current stunning Grand while the rest of the universe may be continually getting bigger and galaxies gently drifting away with the Hubble flow the galaxies of lanaka should always have been able to call it home until dark energy tipped the balance for 5 billion years ago the expansion of the universe diluted all its matter to a point where a new Force could emerge triumphant that force was always there waiting in the shadows part of the very fabric of SpaceTime but it was weak and so it sat in the background content to let the forces of radiation and matter dominate the evolution of the cosmos until its time finally came we still don't definitively understand what dark energy is we merely know what it's doing it's causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate and its influence is only growing as the universe expands its matter contents get more and more spread out but that same expansion creates more Dark Energy whatever it is it appears to be related to the vacuum energy of SpaceTime if you have a completely empty box devoid of all matter and radiation you were left with nothing but vacuum but quantum mechanics tells us that that vacuum is alive a roiling bubbling sea of fundamental particles constantly vibrating in and out of existence and dark energy appears to be a manifestation of that vacuum energy as the universe expands there's more empty space more vacuum and so more Dark Energy 5 billion years ago was the turnover point when the density of matter dropped for the first time below the density of dark energy and since then it's only gotten worse at the present Epoch Dark Energy accounts for roughly 70% of all the contents of the universe in the future it will be 90% then 99% % then even more building up on itself as the universe continues to expand and as that expansion accelerates it only drives the creation of more Dark Energy a process that has no apparent end and shows no sign of slowing down Dark Energy will not let the universe come to rest and it's already begun its process of deconstruction in the voids the voids of our universe are by definition almost entirely empty of matter only the occasional thin filament of ionized gas or small dwarf Galaxy they are almost entirely pure vacuum which means that they are filled with dark energy and driven to expand by the repulsive effects of that dark force the voids are therefore the precise locations within the universe where the accelerated expansion takes place as time goes on the voids will only get bigger and merge driving the galaxies at their edges away from each other faster than their gravitational attraction can keep them together the only objects that will survive the growing Darkness will be those that are already gravitationally bound this means that our local group will survive although transformed as its individual member galaxies coales and it means that clusters like Virgo will also survive safe harbors for the thousands of galaxies that already call it home but the superclusters will not make it d AA shapley and all the millions of others that twist and wind their way to create the backbone of the cosmic web will not maintain their cohesion it is simply too late they simply did not have time to pull themselves close enough together before the forces of dark energy began their work 5 billion years [Music] ago and finally we will never complete our journey the Milky Way will continue on its tragic course with Andromeda but the local group will never make it to the safe shores of the Virgo cluster let alone the great attractor or whatever lies Beyond billions of years from now our Passage through space towards the great attractor will slow down stop and reverse over the course of hundreds of billions of years we will see those distant clusters and galaxies dim and fade from view eventually slipping over our Co mological Horizon caught up in the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy indeed after a long enough time trillions of years from now the Mega Galaxy that was once the local group will be isolated a drift in a sea of nothingness as every other Galaxy slips away but even then our motion will not cease gravitational interactions within the future Galaxy will cause stars to randomly scatter away and once they slip outside its Embrace they too will be caught up in the accelerated expansion flung away as if they were never there one by one star by star our galaxy will diminish the same fate will apply to every macroscopic object hundreds of trillions of years from now each individual body will be completely and utterly isolated from everything else in the universe separated by vast Gulfs of faster than light expansion [Music] and so with nothing left in the wider Universe with no outside frames of reference with no stars to gauge motion against or Hubble flows to compare to with no other sources of attraction or repulsion the universe what's left of it will finally finally come to rest you've been watching the entire history of the universe don't forget to like And

[Music] it was a beautiful night both moons hung low in the Horizon Thin Red crescents their feeble light glimmering on the ocean the Sun a dis of orange that dominated the sky for weeks at a time had finally dipped below the rugged Hills to the north the heat of high summer had passed the evenings were no longer a humid swamp and the sky was now Ablaze with the light of 50,000 stars all the familiar constellations were present as well as hundreds more that only the most Ardent of astronomers Knew by heart suddenly one of the Stars began to brighten onlookers watched in Delight as it grew and grew in intensity this was no cause for alarm Generations ago they had deduced that this was a cosmic explosion the triggering of the death of a nearby massive star but despite their Advanced knowledge they still prefer to call these events by their traditional name a guest star the guest star quickly outshone all of the others in the sky becoming even brighter than the Dozen planets of their system before long it was brighter even than the Dual full moon parties broke out spontaneously across the globe guest stars were common occurring roughly once a year but this was sure to be one for the record books but as most people celebrated one Observer looked on in consternation they were tasked with monitoring wind patterns in the upper atmosphere a few of their satellites were providing realtime information and their measurements indicated a dramatic drop in Ozone levels in perfect conjunction with the increasing Luminosity of the guest star if this continued it appeared that they would lose their protective ozone layer in less than a week though just a story there is no doubt that were a guest star to appear so close CL a supernova it would spell the end of any civilization and in this case on one of the first worlds to arise in the cosmos less than a billion years after the big bang supern noi would have regularly speckled the already crowded night sky the early Universe was an active fertile and violent place at that time galaxies would have been still forming bursting at the seams with round after round of intense star formation and while these explosions enriched the interstellar medium with the heavy elements needed to Fashion rocky planets and possibly life itself they also posed a tremendous risk to any life that emerged and so when did those worlds first emerge and what were they like how can we know what variety of planets there are out there both in the modern day and distant ancient Cosmos the journey to the first planets will take us through an uncountable variety of wondrous worlds from great blue Jupiters with atmospheres of raining glass to Tiny Frozen rocks teetering on the abyss and may even give us hints about the mystery of alien life in the universe the Europa Clipper space probe launched on the 14th of October and will use gravitational ass cysts from Mars and the Earth to arrive at arguably Jupiter's most interesting moon in 2030 of course if those gravitational assists are misjudged even slightly then the probe could spiral off into Oblivion Precision is hugely important when exploring the universe

beginnings of one it may be on a planet not unlike our own a water-rich world orbiting a yellow white star it may be something far different like a parched Moon of a gas giant hugging the limits of habitability around a red dwarf but it's unlikely that the signs of life will be obvious otherwise we would have seen it by now instead they will be subtle mere shifts in the spectrum of light something that only a super telescope of the next generation will be capable of detecting and So Courtney dressing knows that she has to get this right a professor at the University of California Berkeley she was tapped by NASA to co-lead the initial development stages of its next Flagship Mission a telescope so ambitious it will make the James web pale in comparison currently named the habitable world's Observatory the telescope itself won't be launched for decades according to dressing if it were to Be Imagined as a 100 meter race to launch we would be putting on our shoes but the habitable world's Observatory won't just be a planet hunting telescope it will be Humanity's first serious attempt to search for life itself and will do so with an unfolding mirror several times larger than web with that kind of resolving power it will take pictures actual images of dozens of nearby earthlike exoplanets and will have the resolving power needed to search for Bio signatures or traces of elements hinting at the presence of life in their atmospheres while current telescopes like the James web can perform similar kinds of observations they are limited to only giant planets this new super telescope would instead Target earthlike World worlds small rocky planets it is the future of space telescopes and so how far we've come in a mere 30 years for centuries astronomers had assumed that strange alien planets orbited other stars it's not a huge leap in logic our sun is nothing special neither extremely small or extremely large and so there should be nothing special about the appearance of planets in our own solar system thus any average star should probably have planets but what kind of planets and how many does every Star of which there are hundreds of billions in the Milky Way galaxy alone have a planetary system and if it does does that system look like ours with a quartet of rocky planets and a quartet of giants is Jupiter the largest possible and Mercury the smallest and yet as astronomy Advanced into the late 20th Century the vast majority of astronomers believed that it was a Fool's errand to go hunting for other worlds according to Princeton astronomer Josh win exoplanet hunters in the 1980s and '90s worked in an atmosphere of skepticism bordering on hostility the main issue was finding [Music] them planets may seem large to us our own Earth is so vast that its curvature is barely perceptible but they are nothing compared to Stars our own Sun could swallow the entire Earth over a million times and still have room for more the largest planet in the Solar System Jupiter weighs less than 1,000th the mass of the Sun indeed if you were an astronomer viewing the solar system from 10 parex away Jupiter and the sun would appear to be roughly half an arkc separated from each other that's roughly the same visible diameter of a small coin sitting several kilometers away from you and sign isn't the only difficulty when hunting for planets if an object is Luminous enough it can still make itself visible and known to astronomers take neutron stars for example they are no bigger than a typical City and yet they Blaze so intensely they can be seen from millions of light years away but planets don't have any advantages here either the sun is roughly 250 million times brighter than Jupiter and so when the first confirmed exoplanet was discovered in 1992 to it wasn't by any sort of traditional astronomical technique and the planet didn't orbit any traditional kind of astronomical [Music] object two astronomers the Canadian Dale fril and the Polish Alexander volan announced an unexpected Discovery two planets orbiting a pulsar not a nearby star not a midsize star not any of the usual suspect one of the strangest objects in the universe a pulsar is a kind of neutron star that blasts beams of radiation into space as it rotates they are arguably some of the most extreme objects in the universe second only to black holes at only a few kilometers across they are relatively tiny yet due to their crushing Gravity the tallest mountains on their surfaces are only a few millimeters high and if you fell from one you would reach half the speed of light before you hit the ground the fastest Pulsar spins at tens of thousands of revolutions per minute and the pulses they release contain photons with energies 10 trillion times stronger than visible light flooding their surroundings with deadly radiation and yet PSR B1 1257 +2 sitting over 2,000 light years away from the earth in the direction of the Virgo constellation seem to have a planetary system although fril and volan managed to find evidence for them not by studying the system them directly it was much too far away instead they used subtle variations in the pulsing signal from their host star planets do not have much mass compared to their parent star but it's not zero Whispers of gravity can be felt from even the weakest of sources and so as planets orbit their parent Stars they gently tug at them causing the star to wobble ever so slightly this causes amongst other things a Doppler shift in the light coming from the Star the physics behind this is the same as the familiar rising and lowering of pitch of a passing ambulance when the star is moving towards us light gets squeezed to Shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies while the opposite happens when the star is moving away from us pulsars make for exceptionally delicate instruments for measuring Doppler shifts because their pulses are incredibly regular flashing away on our sky with a regularity Cadence and Perfection of Rhythm that compete heat with our own atomic clocks as for fril and volan after they accounted for the motion of the Earth and the Sun the delay in timings due to the pulsar's radio emissions traveling through the interstellar medium and the occasional glitch where the Pulsar suddenly and unexpectedly switches frequencies they found a dobler shift that could only be explained by the presence of two orbiting objects each with a mass roughly four times that of the Earth and after a naming competition held by the international astronomical Union in 2015 Humanity's first two known exoplanets are now known as Poltergeist and phobetor a beast-like character from ID that appears in Dreams they're joined in this strange system by their sibling Drager named after Undead creatures from Norse mythology and discovered in 1994 which is currently the smallest known exoplanet at less than twice the mass of our moon a testament to just how sensitive pulsars can be as exoplanet detectors and the names are fitting pulsars are Undead Stars the leftover cores of once bright living Suns that still emit leftover radiation and so it wasn't until 1995 that astronomers found their first exoplanet orbiting a sunlight star that Discovery required much more Precision determination and outright luck my reaction was that it must be wrong somewhere new Swiss astronomer D Koo of Cambridge University Nobel laurate and one of the discoverers I was a little bit ashamed to communicate this potential error to my supervisor because I thought I'd made a mistake but he had not working with his research advisor and future Nobel co- laate Michelle mayor Koo found the first hints of a reliable signal in the shift of radiation coming from 51 pegasi an unremarkable like Star sitting about 50 light years away but the data implied something truly bizarre the signal implied that the planet was massive roughly the same mass of Jupiter but orbiting far too close to its star just a mere 0.05 astronomical units 1/8 the distance that Mercury orbits from the Sun it would take years to convince the astronomical community of the validity of the observation a condition that Kayla regarded as requiring a soft Insanity to persevere through and yet it would turn out that nature is far Stranger than our imaginations especially when it comes to exoplanets and in the years since that momentous Discovery astronomers have developed an array of techniques for finding exoplanets and analyzing them many even more bizarre than fril and vran's Pulsar planets or koo's Mammoth close orbiting [Music] World take for example the planet hd189733b a gas giant 10% heavier than Jupiter roughly 65 light years away unlike the orange and yellow Hues familiar to Jupiter this exoplanet has a deep cobalt blue atmosphere and that atmosphere is deadly an umbrella wouldn't help you here it rains glass sideways with winds up to seven times the speed of sound or take t s 2B the darkest known exoplanet sitting roughly 700 light years from Earth this exoplanet is exceptionally dark initial estimates suggested it reflects less than 1% of all the light hitting its surface despite its vast size it's larger than Jupiter whatever its atmosphere is made of it's capable of absorbing almost all visible light a close-up approach of t2b would seem like landing on the surface of a black hole and then there's j1407b the super Saturn located 450 light years away a guas giant this exoplanet hosts a ring system that would put Saturns to shame orbiting j1407b are over 30 individual ring systems each one millions of kilometers across all combined the Rings span a diameter of 180 million kilm and contain an entire Earth's mass of material making it over 600 times larger than and Saturns the Rings utterly dwarf the planet itself and so picture in your mind the wildest Planet imaginable with whatever fanciful composition and orbit you can dream of chances are that this planet exists and thousands more [Music] Beyond but when it comes to discovering new exoplanets alongside the dobler shift method more properly known as the radial velocity technique the most powerful scheme is called the transit method and it involves nothing more than staring at a star for a long period of time and waiting Planet hunting with the transit method involves searching the heavens for tiny eclipses if a star hosts a planet and the plane of its orbit just happens to line up with our point of view then occasionally the planet will cross in front of the face of its star temporarily blocking a small amount of light this effect is minuscule and relies on pure luck but if you stare at Enough stars for long enough periods of time you'll eventually detect The Telltale sign of a planetary Transit event and in 2009 NASA's Kepler space telescope became the world's Premier Planet Hunter this telescope continuously observed roughly half a million stars in the direction of the constellation signus searching for signs of slight dimming that mission alone produced a treasure Trove of nearly 3,000 confirmed exoplanets and thousands more candidates even one of the very first planets found by the Kepler space telescope was full of Wonders something ripped straight from science fiction kepus 16b is a gas giant with a mass between Saturn and Jupiter sitting 245 Li years away what made it surprising was not the planet itself but the system Kepler 16b doesn't just orbit one star but twoo the first ever confirmed circumbinary planet sitting on the surface of the planet you could watch as its twin Suns dipped below the Horizon in a recreation of the iconic Star Wars scene but despite the success of the transit method astronomers need a variety of tools to paint as complete a portrait as possible for every exoplanet especially in the hunt for the very first in the universe the transit method is by far the easiest method known to find exoplanets but it only gives a measure of the planet's radius based on the dip in the Stars light astronomers have to use other methods to estimate the planet's mass from there they turn to complex modeling to make reasonable guesses as to a planet's composition and structure for example we generally know the abundance of elements in the universe and how they interact with each other if a planet is roughly the same size and mass as the Earth then it's less likely to be made of Light Elements like hydrogen and helium and more likely to be made of carbon silicon and water Kepler's successor the transiting exoplanet survey satellite or Tess for short uses a variety of methods packaged into one spacecraft to measure as many properties as possible at present 6 years since the launch of the mission Tess has identified 7,138 candidates exoplanets and in 2024 Tess discovered tiic 36512 760b a planet sitting 18800 light years from Earth the discoverers nicknamed it Phoenix and for good reason this planet is so close to its parent star that it should be nothing but a roasted Cinder especially after its star entered its red giant phase but somehow this world has retained its atmosph spere an incredible and so far unexplainable feat but astronomers suspect that this act of planetary resistance won't last long and the world will lose its grip on its own atmosphere in less than 100 million years the next great Planet Hunter will be the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope which is currently scheduled to launch in May of 2027 its unique properties will allow it to create a census of up to a million exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy but perhaps the most important method of revealing an exoplanet is studying its light directly during a Transit event most of the light reaching out telescopes comes from the parent star directly but some of that light is either reflected off the planet or passes through its atmosphere this contamination of the light is incredibly small but if we capture a strong enough signal during the transit event we can isolate the contributions from the planet and measure some of the elements present for this technique however we can only use the most powerful most sensitive instruments like the Hubble or James web space telescopes indeed web was designed with exactly this goal in mind and already it has mapped the atmospheres of scores of exoplanets finding evidence for molecules such as methane carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide and more and it is web that has shown us that not all exop planets are Grim wastelands there are also those that show the hopeful signs of life like k218b a planet sitting only 120 light years from Earth and first studied in detail with the new telescope in 2023 this world is a sub Neptune and a spectrum of its abundant atmosphere shows the faint signatures of methane and carbon dioxide these elements are certainly possible in a lifeless atmosphere but also in a life-filled one and so our hunt for alien worlds is still in its infancy and yet even with only a few thousand confirmed detections we have deduced the existence of Worlds that we could not possibly have imagined the universe is bewildering in complexity and dizzying in its scope and exoplanets are no exception as we attempt to plunge deep into the depths of the past to discover the first exoplanets we must begin by confronting the amazing variety that could possibly [Music] exist the planet is being tun apart before our very eyes its parent however is fairly normal a kype star slightly smaller and cooler than the sun sitting about 66 light years away but it hosts a small family of planets in a peculiar series of orbits a gas giant with a very tight 56-day orbit roughly twice the distance that Mercury orbits around the sun and a second planet roughly the mass of Uranus sitting even closer to its star with just a 14-day orbit and in 2024 a team of astronomers led by Steven k at the University of California Riverside announced the tentative discovery of yet another body this was no gas giant but a terrestrial World 30% wider than the earth but clinging to the star in a brutal 2.2 day orbit of course no life like the exists on this planet no atmosphere no water this world is scorched by its proximity to its star but that's not the only source of its Horrors the dance of the gas giants in their Incredibly Close orbits means that they exert enormous tidal forces on the earthlike planet stretching and squeezing it like putty the tidal forces are easy enough to calculate just a simple application of Newton's laws and it's also easy to calculate how much energy is transferred from the orbits of the giant siblings into tidal deformations of the small terrestrial world and the conclusion is startling the constant stretching and squeezing pulled here and there by the gravitational forces of the Giants releases so much energy that the world itself is glowing bought in the midst of a perfect tidal storm with an estimated surface temperature of 2,600 kelv this earthlike planet is lit up like an incandescent light bulb but this is no mere speculation or flight of Science Fiction this is a sound scientific estimation based on a surprisingly small amount of information and just one example of how clever research can reveal the Wonders and Majesty of world's millions of Li years away in almost all cases for these thousands of known alien planets all we truly know about them is a thin slice of data represented by a line on a plot but astronomers are enormously clever and used to making great leaps of insight based on meager scraps because that line is a spectrum the concept of atomic Spectra was developed in the mid 1800s before we even understood the nature of atoms and subatomic particles indeed explaining Atomic Spectra was one of the primary motivations towards the development of quantum mechanics each element on the periodic table emits light at a combination of very specific wavelengths and each molecule does the same when astronomers look at a distant exoplanet as it transits in front of its parent star some of the light filters through the planet's atmosphere and the elements and molecules of that atmosphere spere each leave their individual fingerprint on the Spectrum and so by examining the Spectrum astronomers can identify the presence of many elements but it is far from Easy astronomers need high resolution data and a raw volume of Starlight to get a solid spectrum and in the often hot and complex atmosphere of alien worlds molecules can mix together in the same Spectrum especially in the narrow range of wavelengths that astronomers can usually only access from there astronomers turn to modeling to to build their understanding of these foreign worlds we understand how physics and chemistry work we know how atmospheres can react to different intensities of different wavelengths of light we know how gravity affects the ability of a planet to retain an atmosphere and we know how molecules mix and dance together in an atmosphere it does require some guesswork and statements about exoplanets always up for aevision but through these techniques astronomers have been able to deduce an astounding variety and complexity of planets within the Galaxy perhaps the greatest surprise of all was that we were able to detect exoplanets so easily in the 1990s that's because the first known exoplanets were completely unlike anything we'd ever known from our experience in the solar system planets far larger than Jupiter orbiting closer than Mercury does around the Sun these worlds are known as Jupiters and they should be impossible giant planets can't form close to stars because these planets are made of mostly hydrogen and helium the lightest of the elements that get easily Blown Away by the energetic output of young stars and yet hot Jupiters aren't just our first known exoplanets they are among the most common astronomers now believe that hot Jupiters start out their lives in distant orbits but through gravitational interaction actions and planetary reshuffling find themselves migrating inwards to closer orbits where they spend the rest of their days roasting alive indeed some hot Jupiters experience such intense radiation that they are bloed and distended in some cases tidal forces turning them egg-shaped while hot Jupiters are certainly fascinating they are unlikely homes for life at least the kind of life that we know the kind of life that arises on small rocky planets in the habitable zones of their stars but exoplanet surveys have found many such worlds especially around small red dwarf stars because those are easier to find with our current techniques while we have yet to confirm the existence of liquid water on any extra Solar Planet we have many candidates well deserving of follow-up investigation with the habitable world's Observatory but we just don't know how many exoplanets exist in the Milky Way at a bare minimum we suspect that there is on average one planet for every Star but many estimates suggest that planets are much more common than that including rough estimates on the number of rogue planets exoplanets without a parent star drifting through Interstellar space there may be trillions of worlds in our galaxy alone and so no matter what despite Decades of effort we've only surveyed an incredibly small fraction of all the planets in the Milky Way But even with this scarcity of data we can start to build a rough estimate of the number of potentially habitable worlds in the galaxy and start to put together a picture of how early in the history of the universe planets could have Arisen and those guesses suggest that if we are searching for life and want to hunt for that life on earth-sized planets orbiting sunlike Stars within their habitable zones then we may have as many as 5 billion planets to search for 5 billion chances for life our Earth as unique and special and rare as it is may have billions of siblings and the Earth is far from alone with even the beginnings of these searches astronomers have been able to discover an astounding variety of exoplanets each of them completely foreign to anything in our own solar system smashing the expectations of astronomers from Generations past besides hot Jupiter's and their too close for comfort orbits there are the com binary planets worlds that orbit two stars at once there are even double planets objects of roughly equal mass that orbit a Common Center if Pluto qualified as a planet it would likely be counted as a double Planet due to its relationship with Sharon there are rogue planets that wander the interstellar wastes and Trojan planets that follow a larger sibling in its orbit there are super Earths and many Neptunes worlds of every conceivable size larger than Jupiter and smaller than Mercury there are worlds covered in ice in lava in thick layers of hydrogen there are dry and airless worlds and ocean covered water planets there are planets without cause and planets with almost no crust there are Worlds made of an abundance of carbon or an abundance of silicon or an abundance of iron Decades of searches have Unearthed thousands of Worlds which represents only a tiny sliver of those in the Milky Way But even with that meager sample we found ourselves continually surprised it seems that galaxies are enormously efficient at producing planets and this efficiency may have allowed them to construct planets as early as possible in their histories and perhaps in the history of the universe unfortunately we do not fully understand the process of Planet formation as it unfolds over the course of hundreds of millions of years but in addition to fully formed exoplanets we also have thousands of detailed observations of young Stars protoplanetary discs and more we can stitch these collected images together to form the backbone of an overall story and from there attempt to predict how early planets could have formed in the young universe planetary systems like our own begin their lives as diffused clouds of hydrogen helium and a smattering of heavier elements when these clouds collapse to form a system system most of the material in each of these fragments coalesces towards the center where friction Heats it to high temperatures becoming a protostar a star that has not yet ignited Fusion in its core the material eventually forms a flat plane around the protostar the beginnings of a protoplanetary disc the vast majority of the disc is made of hydrogen and helium but sprinkled throughout the swirling chaos is dust microscopic grains of heavy more complex molecules just like the dust that clings irritatingly to the surfaces of your home the dust in a protoplanetary dis sticks together finding each other in the spinning sea of lighter gases the dust begins to Clump molecule by molecule over the span of hundreds of thousands of years these clumps become large enough roughly 100 m or so to completely change the fate of the disc at roughly this size the clumps now known as as planetesimals have a gravitational pull of their own which they use to inflate their size by attracting new material within the inner regions of the disk near the young star which has finally begun fusing hydrogen the heat is too much for Light Elements like hydrogen and helium to remain and too much for volatile elements like water and carbon dioxide to stay as solid IES only the heavier elements like iron carbon and silicon and their molecular combinations can survive here the inner regions of a solar system therefore become the home of terrestrial worlds and the outer regions form the larger gaseous [Music] worlds and this process repeating generation after generation star after star across the nearly countless billions fills each and every Galaxy with a population of planets so with this picture in mind it seems that heavy elements are a prerequisite for building planets and even though planets are numerous they are small the Earth or Jupiter or any exoplanet may seem enormous to human scales but they represent mere rounding errors in the cosmic accounting of elements it is clear that once there is even a small amount of raw material the simple physics of the universe will give rise to a planet but how long did it take for the cosmos to generate enough raw [Music] material planets do not farewell in the face of a Dying star and the small rocky World precariously close to the guest star as it went supernova was no exception first came the flood of gamma ray radiation stripping away the the ozone layer which for billions of years had protected life on their world from the harmful UV radiation of the Sun the oceans overheated and plants and algae could not withstand the radiation tearing apart the heart of the food web then came the high energy particles known as cosmic rays ripping through the planet's magnetic field and showering the surface with deadly energies cancers of all kinds across all species spread like a global pandemic and then centuries later civilization long crippled came the final blow a shock wve weakened as it expanded out from the initial explosion but still powerful enough to tear the atmosphere of the planet away like dandelion seeds in the wind had the Supernova that claimed their home World been any closer than even the mantle and inner core might have been evaporated in the ensuing blast as it was the planet they once called home was just as dead a Barren husk of rock its once verdant lands and abundant oceans Now dust on a frozen Breeze the young universe was not friendly to life billions of years ago the cosmos was much smaller than it is today galaxies were much closer together and they collided with each other other much more frequently stars formed at an intense rate indeed some galaxies produce Stars thousands of times more often than the Milky Way does now and as those stars formed they also died in magnificent and frequent Supernova explosions irradiating their vicinity and posing a serious Hazard to any life that managed to find a foothold in this hostile era thankfully planets are exceptionally easy to make the first stars to emerge in the universe ver were made entirely of hydrogen helium and Trace Amounts of lithium and burum as those were the only elements fashioned in the fires of the Big Bang they fused heavier elements in their cores and even more through their explosive deaths seeding young galaxies with the ingredients needed to begin building planets and so although we do not know when this process first began we do know it didn't take long consider the star toi 561 t561 is a sunlike star sitting roughly 280 light years away the stars go at first glance it's pretty unremarkable it's 79% the mass of the Sun and 85% of its radius if you were to see it with your own eyes it would look just like any other star just tinted slightly orange but toi 561 isn't just old it's ancient it is over twice the age of our sun having formed roughly 102 billion years ago right when the Milky Way galaxy was first emerging in its own right and when toi 561 formed the Milky Way wasn't nearly as enriched with heavier elements as it is today and so in the awkward nomenclature of astronomers they classify this star as metal pore toi 561 is one of the oldest stars to inhabit our galaxy and in January of 2021 a team of astronomers led by Lauren Vice at the University of Hawaii and monoa announced an unexpected Discovery it has a family of planets this was confirmed by an independent analysis undertaken by guia lardelli of the University of padaa it was no mere fluke of the data one of the planets orbiting this ancient star is a super Earth weighing twice the mass of our planet on a Breakneck orbit that lasts only 10 hours besides the mysteries of its extreme orbit the mere existence of this world opens up a confusing question how how did a rocky planet composed of the heavier elements of the periodic table form around a star that has barely any of these elements this question still lingers on with no clear resolution for decades astronomers had assumed that stars and their planets go hand in hand when a star has a higher abundance of heavier elements it should be able to Fashion more and larger Rocky worlds but it seems that the cosmos has designs of its own despite its age toi 561 was still able to grow a healthy planetary system with more than enough material for rocky earthlike planets of course it doesn't seem likely that the super Earth that orbits this ancient star is a viable home for life as it is currently roasting in the Ferocious heat of its parent star due to its extreme proximity but if super Earths could form around toi 561 10 A2 billion years ago then it's not a great stretch of the imagination to argue that regular Earths could have formed around the same time [Music] life first appeared on the earth almost as soon as our surface cooled and the oceans and continents arose it seems as if once our planet could support life it did and so perhaps some World amongst the trillions yet to be mapped observed or discovered around a Stella cousin of toi 561 had just the right combination of elements temperatures and conditions for life to arise if that life followed the same evolutionary pathway as life did on Earth spending billions of years as single- celled organisms transforming the atmosphere to make it more hospitable and laying down the genetic building blocks for an explosion in complexity leading to the emergence of intelligence then a starfaring species could have evolved while our own solar system was nothing more than a tenuous cloud of gas and dust floating through Interstellar space life in the early universe would have been challenging the cosmos was simply more active and more volatile billions of years ago resulting in higher rates of star formation and Stellar death soaking every Galaxy in more high energy radiation indeed planets may have quickly formed around most stars but any life that may have emerged on these worlds would have had to navigate the ultimate catastrophe the Supernova explosion of their own Sun simulations of planets around Supernova suggest that they do not fare well in the face of of such enormous energies at best the dense nickel and iron cores remain with everything else atmosphere oceans and mantle evaporating in the blast and yet once again nature gives us a surprising twist just like the apparent impossibility of hot Jupiters planets should not exist around pulsars which are the leftover cores of giant stars that survived after a supernova explosion but our very first known exoplanet was found orbiting a pulsar we do not yet fully understand how planets can find themselves living around a dead star one theory is that they have always been there but that is unlikely since giant Stars the kind of stars that go supernova are very hot and boil off their protoplanetary discs before Planet formation can really get going another idea is that planets form around pulsars from the Supernova material itself after initially blasting off with a fraction of the speed of light much of the material cools off and coalesces around the neutron star introducing a fresh new round of Planet formation these kinds of ideas highlight just how easy Planet formation really is it can even happen around a dead star and so we can guess that rocky planet formation happened in the extremely early Universe perhaps within the first billion years of cosmic history as soon as enough generations of Stars lived and died to enrich the interstellar gas clouds with heavy elements and as for Life while we can't say for certain it certainly had a chance on these young worlds despite the chaos raging through their violent emerging galaxies planets almost certainly formed that were suitable many attempts at life were likely snuffed out by an energetic explosion or gravitational destabilization but the universe made planets in abundance and it's very likely that somewhere billions of years ago when the first stars and galaxies began to fill the cosmos with light some creature called one of those primordial worlds home but so far we've only considered Rocky worlds terrestrial planets like our Earth fashioned out of heavier elements with oceans of liquid water life may be far stranger than we imagine and so too might the planet's life calls home if we are willing to extend our definition of planet we might just be able to push back into the depths of time even [Music] further araco remembers on January the 1st 2019 Humanity got its first close-up view of a world that had known only Darkness the object was known as araco a word from the poweron language of the Tidewater region of the Eastern United States the language became extinct in the 1700s but the word is still remembered today meaning either sky or Cloud araco sits in the Kyer belt region of the solar system a distant and lonely ring of scattered Frozen leftovers from our systems formation it is small gray and dirty two is shapen lumps of ice and dust roughly 36 km long and 15 to 20 km on a side glued together by a gentle bump billions of years ago the object has only ever been visited once in a flyby lasting mere minutes by NASA's new horizon spacecraft a project led by Alan Stern and launched in 2009 we only know one face of araco because the flyby did not last long enough to get a full View and the probe was traveling far too quickly and carried too too little fuel to park itself into orbit but in this little object is written the story of Miracles for aroth is incredibly ancient it was present when the protoplanetary dis of our solar system first coalesced escaping to the fringes during the chaotic era of the first planetesimals it watched as new planets emerged out of the swirling Maelstrom crashing and colliding and forming a new some being ejected into the interstellar wastes as the survivors four rocky interplanet two gas giants and two ice giants rearranged themselves into a series stable orbit and araco waited for billions upon billions of years knowing nothing more than the dim and distant light of the Sun and its feble but persistent gravitational grip one foot in the solar system and the other poised Ed towards the Stars Beyond and then a little spacecraft no bigger than a piano sped by its first visitor in the ages since its formation but before araco could even register the presence of New Horizons whether through the slight radar signals bouncing off its surface or the minute deflections of its gravitational influence it was gone and so araco resumed its watchful senty at the gates of the solar system araco represents not just a lonely Outpost in our solar system it's a tiny clump of dust and Ice far smaller than any Planet barely noticeable in the cosmic scene but it's much easier for the universe to make small clumps of debris like aroth than it is to make massive planets like the Earth let alone the Giants like Jupiter and objects like aroth are more likely to survive any catastrophe that might Beall their system like the death of a giant planet or the imploding of a sun and so just how early could something like araco [Music] form the objects of the Kyer belt are made of relatively simple common elements like hydrogen carbon silicon and oxygen hydrogen was made in abundance within the first few minutes of the Big Bang so that's easy enough carbon and oxygen were fused in the hearts of stars the size of the sun and larger so silon is only made in larger stars but those stars were exceptionally common in the early Universe the following is pure conjecture but is based on our latest understanding of star formation the first Stars appeared in the universe when it was only a few 100 million years old that's how long it took for Gravity to do its work on the primordial clouds of hydrogen and helium and collapse them enough to trigger nuclear fusion it would take many generations of Stellar births and deaths to enrich the inter a gas clouds enough to form significant numbers of planets but something like aroth or its Kyer belil siblings could have formed much earlier perhaps within the first handful of Stellar Generations before the first Galaxy arose before the first giant black hole arose when the cosmos was just a loose collection of scattered and lonely clumps of newborn Stars their feeble light flickering For the First Time In the Lonely depths one star somewhere forever beyond our detection or reach found itself surrounded by a thin protoplanetary disc with just Trace Amounts of heavier elements an object like araco could have formed in the cold fringes of the system the first substantial body composed of rock and ises the first solid object While most astronomers do not consider any object in the Kyer belt a proper Planet some of them are classed as minor or dwarf planets and it may have been such a dwarf planet at first formed in an age before even galaxies had evolved though it is unlikely that this first dwarf planet could have hosted life their own formation depends on ises that can only remain solid far from the light and heat of its parent star but there is another kind of Planet much larger than any dwarf planet or Kyper belt object that could have emerged in the early universe that might have supported [Music] life these are the haen worlds a name coined by a group of University of Cambridge researchers as a port Mano of hydrogen and ocean at present these planets are only hypothetical but astronomers have identified several candidates in the Kepler and test surveys hon planets are massive approaching the size of Neptune but most of that bulk comes in the form of thick atmospheres of hydrogen indeed these atmospheres can be thick enough that they maintain enough pressure on the surface that liquid water can persist perhaps as Globe spanning oceans they may have formed in the extremely early Universe a relatively small nugget of rock enrobed in an ocean of water buried underneath a dense atmosphere of easily obtainable [Music] hydrogen but the oldest known planet is no super Earth or mini Neptune it's not a hot Jupiter or a hen world it's not a fragment or a comet its formal designation is PSR b1620 d26 B but most astronomers called it Methuselah after the biblical character who lived to be the oldest person methusa was discovered in 2003 by Stein sigon of Pennsylvania State University in the globular cluster M4 globular clusters themselves are amongst the oldest collections of stars in the galaxy believed to be remnants of galaxies in their own right before they were cannibalized by the Milky Way Methuselah is a pulsar Planet like the first ever known exoplanet orbiting a dead core of a once great star it is huge weighing over 2 and a half times the mass of Jupiter orbiting around its star at roughly the same distance that Uranus does around the Sun but its parent star is not alone there's also a white dwarf orbiting much closer to the Pulsar while we can't directly estimate the age of Methuselah we can determine the age of the globular cluster that it makes for its home and stars in a globular cluster appear at roughly the same time so while there is significant uncertainty Methuselah currently holds the record for the oldest known exoplanet achieving a present day age of roughly 12.7 billion years like all Pulsar planets astronomers aren't exactly sure how methusa formed but given its tremendous bulk and its relatively regular distance from the star most astronomers believe that methusa formed around a sunlike star in the outskirts of the globular cluster almost 13 billion years ago the star and its bulky Planet then migrated towards the center of M4 and it's there that the planet witnessed a drama unfold before it the system likely encountered an old neutron star and its companion star a common Denison of old clusters like M4 through gravit interactions a dance ensued with the neutron star capturing the wandering star and ejecting its old companion in the process once stabilized Methuselah's star then aged normally eventually becoming a red giant its swollen atmosphere spilled onto the neutron star transferring energy and angular momentum and causing the neutron star to spin up to become a pulsar rotating at a rate of 100 times per second after Methuselah's Original Parent star exits the red GI stage it becomes a white dwarf and after all this drama played out methusa remained for billions of years however methusa itself is an unlikely candidate for life at least for Life as we currently understand it just like any other gas giant but the material to make a planet can also make a moon and a system doesn't need nearly as many raw heavy elements to Fashion as a series of moons around such a [Music] giant and so there is a chance 13 billion years ago that some form of life arose in some alien ocean buried under the globe spanning ice sheets of a moon around Methuselah it may or may not have awakened into Consciousness or pierced the ice sheets to witness the drama of its parent star or the quiet calm of the billions of years since or the Majesty of the Milky Way visible in all its resplendant Glory from the vantage point of the globular cluster indeed if life did find a home on a moon of Methuselah it would have been shielded by that ice from the cosmic dangers of the early Universe the radiation from Supernova explosions the heat from the Red Giant star it could have persisted and even thrived it may even still be there the oldest living creatures orbiting the oldest known planet the end result of a genetic lineage going all the way back to the dawn of stars and galaxies themselves retaining a memory of a cosmos far unlike our own if they had ice and Minds filled with curiosity they could have watched the entire Milky Way emerge and evolve before them and if they develop telescopes to allow them to peer deeper into that Galaxy they might train their curiosity on a small insignificant branch of one of the great spiral arms and in their detailed careful observations they might come across a star not unlike the one that once hosted their system they would find a gas giant smaller than theirs but still Mighty among its family of planets and they would detect the thin atmosphere of a water-rich world and in that atmosphere the unmistakable sign of that planet's life that is only recently arrived on the galactic [Music] scene you've been watching the

how many numbers would you need to describe the moon to begin with it's pockmarked with a wide variety of craters from different asteroid impacts over billions of years a similar exomoon orbiting a similar EXO Earth in a different solar system even if superficially alike would have a completely different pattern of asteroid impacts to characterize each precisely at a minimum we would need to give two coordinates latitude and longitude for every one of the thousands of craters along with the size of each crater very rapidly we find ourselves needing thousands of numbers to describe a moon even before we start talking about the chemical composition of the moon's surface and how that varies in different regions the number of numbers we need quickly expands from thousands to millions and [Music] Beyond and that is just a moon one of the comparatively more simple objects in the cosmos how many more numbers would it take to describe a planet a star a nebula or indeed how many numbers would it take to describe the most massive single object in the entire universe a black hole the answer for these monsters may surprise you three three numbers and no more no matter how heavy they they are no matter where they were formed no matter whether they are in our own Milky Way galaxy or a billion light years away three numbers and only three are sufficient to Define them completely on the one hand this makes black holes seem like very simple objects only three parameters are necessary to classify them their Mass electric charge and angular momentum know these three numbers and you have everything and yet there are an enormous number of ways to form a black hole they can be formed by gradually swallowing up gas and dust over billions of years they can be formed by the direct collapse of a massive star in a type 2 Supernova perhaps yet another could grow through repeated merges of other black hole pairs we could even imagine a hypothetical black hole formed from the contents of every encyclopedia and every electronic Data Bank of every civilization in the Galaxy every piece of information and every single number ever thought or said by anyone ever anything and everything in the universe can go into a black hole and yet once it is formed all of that information is reduced to three numbers how the black hole was made and what went into it becomes almost irrelevant and so the question is given this almost uncountably large number of possibilities for making a black hole how can they then be described by just three numbers where is all the other information gone has the black hole forgotten about its origins or does this information survive in some hidden form just what is inside a black hole and what could it mean for the rest of the [Music]

educational content on YouTube in the 1780s the position of a country priest in the Church of England was not especially demanding a large house with a decent income a group of servants to do the household chores and younger curates to take services and visit the sick to those who wanted it a lazy life of leisure was on offer but to those who wanted something more there was time to think deeply about the world around them and this is how English Parson John Mitchell spent his time by the 1780s Mitchell had a pretty good idea of how gravity worked a century earlier Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation had shocked the scientific World gravity Newton argued was a universal Force anything that had Mass gravitated pulled instantaneously on everything else nothing could avoid the force of gravity not even Mitchell mused light itself for as well as thinking about gravity Newton had also argued that light consisted of tiny individual particles little atoms of Light which we would Now call photons if this theory of light as particles were true and gravity was Universal then gravity should be acting on these tiny particles of light tugging at them and pulling them back and Mitchell also knew that light traveled fast very very fast indeed earlier in the 18th century the astronomer James Bradley had measured the speed of light and measured it well and accurately through thinking about the aberration of light from distant stars as the Earth moves through its orbit the vector combination of the velocity of the Earth and the velocity of light changes just a tiny amount but enough to change very slightly the apparent location of stars in the sky through this the speed of light was known to be around 180,000 m/s this was fast but not infinite and finally intuitively Mitchell knew that an object thrown upwards would fall back down but if thrown upwards fast enough this does not happen instead it is enough speed to escape the Earth's gravity and reach space the threshold value known as the escape Velocity is the minimal speed of vertical launch required to escape a planet's gravity and reach Infinite Space it's an easy calculation in Newton's theory of gravity to work out this escape velocity for any given planet and how it depends on the size and density of the object the more massive the object and the more dense it is the bigger the escape velocity for example for the moon this escape velocity is around 2.4 km/s for the Earth this becomes around 11.2 km/s for Jupiter just under 60 km/s and for her own Sun roughly 617 km/s but imagine an even denser body what about a body thought Mitchell which was sufficiently dense that its escape velocity exceeded the speed of life light for such a body the light emitted from the surface would not be able to escape in this case such a body would appear as gravitationally massive but entirely dark trapping even light under the pull of its Gravity the language and argument here is that of Newtonian physics that would be replaced by Einstein's theories but the concept it is describing lives on and is clearly recognizable and Mitchell's work was although the actual name would not be used for almost two centuries the first description of what we now call a black [Music] hole but Mitchell was way way ahead of his time and his results seemed no more than an abstract curiosity it therefore went into the scientific backd drawer and stayed there for 150 years and the next time this drawer would be opened would be in the miserable trenches of the first world war where the German astronomer Carl swart Shield desperate for an escape from the hell surrounding him pondered the equations of Einstein's brand new theory of general relativity having developed the special theory of relativity in 1905 10 years later Einstein succeeded in extending it to include gravity constructing his general theory of relativity this Theory requires 10 equations to describe it but when first written down they looked formidable and almost impossible to solve and so in trying to solve them SAR looked for the simplest possible solution he could imagine a spherically symmetric SpaceTime around a concentrated point-like Mass plugging everything in and calculating carefully he obtained a solution now known as the spart Shield solution probably the most famous solution of Einstein's equations spart Shield solution involves one parameter a uniform spherical mass in general relativity Mass deforms the nearby SpaceTime the magnitude of this deformation depends on the radial coordinate the closer to the mass the bigger the deformation while far away there is little change and the spart Shield solution had one deep and striking property visible in it there was a critical distance from the mass where something strange happened some terms in the solution appeared to go to Zer While others went to Infinity what did this mean although it was not possible to go through the full mathematical derivation these zeros and Infinities at a critical radius known as the spart Shield radius indicated the presence of an event horizon for the black hole solution a spherical Shell at a certain distance from the center of the black hole that represented a point of no return for objects coming in from far away no object can move faster than the speed of light outside the Horizon an object moving at the speed of light away from the black hole can escape its gravitational pull but any closer to the black hole than the Event Horizon there could be no Escape not even for light the laws of physics themselves forbade any Escape any astronaut that crosses the black hole Event Horizon finds thems on a one-way passage towards the center of the black hole once inside the Event Horizon time always points towards the very center of the black hole as the astronaut Falls further in the pull of gravity becomes stronger and stronger and so they continue falling until they reach the singularity itself a place where the laws of classical general relativity break down and the curvature of SpaceTime becomes formly infinite this was similar to Mitchell's calculation of a radius where the escape Velocity exceeded the speed of light if a certain Mass was condensed into a radius smaller than its swart Shield radius it would collapse inescapably the spart Shield radius for our sun is around 3 kilm and for the Earth it is less than a CM a human spart Shield radius is on the order of 10 to the power of minus 23 smaller than the nucleus of an atom and if all the stars and gas and dust within the Milky Way Were Somehow condensed into a radius less than 0.2 light years a truly Mammoth black hole would eventually form spart Shield solution was found in 1915 but as with Mitchell's work for half a century seemed merely an intellectual curiosity did it mean anything physical or was it simply a mathematical artifact unfortunately for the study of black holes as quantum mechanics revolutionized one branch of physics after another throughout the 1920s 30s and 40s gravity and general relativity were viewed very much as a Backwater the ments of American physicist Richard fean on a conference on gravity he attended in the early 1960s give an idea of what people thought about it I'm not getting anything out of this meeting I'm learning nothing because there are no experiments this field is not an active one so few of the best men are doing work in it the result is that there are hosts of dopes here and it's not good for my blood [Music] pressure but the state of the field described in Fan's costic summary would all change in the late 1960 S as a combination of theoretical and observational breakthroughs brought Research into black holes and general relativity back with a vengeance and this has remained the case to the present day and in the public mind there is one scientist more than any other associated with this Renaissance among the icons of 20th century physics Steven Hawking holds a privileged place his remarkable life story has inspired Millions born in 1942 he studied undergraduate physics at Oxford before moving to Cambridge to do a PhD but during his Doctorate Hawking's life changed drastically in two connected ways first at the age of 21 he was diagnosed with a degenerative muscle wasting motor neuron disease which had a typical life expectancy from diagnosis of around 18 months and second having coasted to a first class honors degree at Oxford for the first time in his life he started working hard and with intensity as the prospect of early death loomed he threw himself into his work with a desire to achieve something and leave a legacy of his talent of course Hawking would end up outliving anyone else with the disease eventually dying in 2018 at the age of 76 as one of the most celebrated and famous scientists in the world and the scientific reasons for this Fame came from the first black hole Renaissance mostly occurring in the years from 1967 to 1974 in which a period of extraordinary collaborative creativity between Hawking and the mathematician Roger Penrose upturned the stale subject of general [Music] relativity together Hawking and Penrose proved a set of key theorems if you start with a group of heavy particles close together and pulling on each other under Gravity is not intuitively clear what will happen perhaps they will collapse and form a black hole but perhaps they will also slingshot off each other and Escape Hawking and Penrose resolved this question they showed that under quite General conditions collections of matter particles under Gravity would collapse and that the inescapable end point of that collapse would be a singularity in the fabric of SpaceTime surrounded by a black hole this result was not about Intuition or hope or expectation it was proof this Hawking penr collaboration also changed how relativists thought about space and time through a novel conceptual visualization called Penrose diagrams these simplified much of the complexity of many solutions to Einstein's equation suddenly it was possible to have a simple and complete global view of what could affect what when thinking about black holes a clear diagram to illustrate the causal structure of SpaceTime in these diagrams light always traveled at 45° making it possible to see easily which points in SpaceTime could causally affect which other points in this language The Horizon could be viewed as the crossover where there can no longer be any causal contact with space infinitely far away as his body wasted away Hawking's mind soared and his imagination stretched across space and time there was good reason to think that the fanciful objects described by these squiggles on the page black holes really could exist in the galaxy and luckily at the same time the quality of astronomical telescopes was improving rapidly as satellites became capable of launching telescopes into space for the first time the sky could be observed above the clouds and not just in Optical light but also in other wave bands such as X-rays and it was this that led to a shock the X-ray sky was Far busier and crowded than expected in fact there was one source that was especially bright and compact known as signus X1 where were so many energetic x-rays coming from how could they arise from so small a region there was only one good candidate to explain the data the presence of a compact black hole with the energetic x-rays given off as matter was accelerated folding into it since the first discovery of signess X1 as a black hole in the 1970s many more have been discovered there may be as many as a 100 million black holes in our own Galaxy alone and in 2015 colliding black holes were first observed as the gravitational waves emitted from their Collision were picked up by the ligo observatory in the United States but the excitement about black holes in this period did not come only from astrophysical observations of the Galaxy in offices and on blackboards in Long equations furiously written down in late night bursts of creativity the theoretical exploration of them became a bizarre new playground for The Most Extreme questions in the cosmos [Music] nothing is more familiar to us than the human face while easy to recognize their basic shape they come with an almost infinite variability age complexion hair shade and style freckles and moles the smiles the teeth the skin freshness how many numbers and how much information would you need to specify any human face completely a lot something much less familiar and apparently more exotic is a black hole and yet in a way they are far far simpler and that was reflected in the solutions to Einstein's [Music] equations despite this it was not easy to find these Solutions soon after spart Shield's 1915 discovery of the simplest black hole solution another generalization was uncovered an electrically charged black hole the rer Nordstrom solution but it was not until almost 50 years later in 1963 that the most important generalization of the spart Shield solution appeared this was the Kerr solution named after the New Zealander relativist Roy Kerr like the spart Shield solution this also described an uncharged black hole but this was one with angular momentum or spin a black hole spinning on its own axis think of a super massive ballerina rapidly spinning extremely heavy arms stretched out this Cosmic ballerina is heavy enough to be almost but not quite at the threshold density to form a black hole as she brings her arms in to increase her rotational speed she passes this threshold density and immediately collapses to a black hole but this is a spinning black hole the angular momentum she had prior to the collapse has not disappeared appeared it has gone into the black hole and this is reflected in the Cur solution but why did there seem to be so few black hole Solutions only the spart Shield solution the Cur solution and their generalizations to include electric charge indeed this limited number was not through lack of effort for as physicists studied the equations of general relativity and thought about what type of solutions led to black holes they first suspected and then later proved something distinctive about these black hole Solutions a result now known as the black hole uniqueness theorem with remarkable implications most astronomical objects have an almost infinite number of individual characteristics quazars are vast Cosmic engines through the brutal friction and temperatures created by their Central black hole they form a superpowered Dynamo trillions upon trillions of numbers numbers would be needed to successfully describe and recreate an even vaguely similar object Stars though superficially much more straight forward come in almost endless variety and evolve dramatically through their lifetime from the super massive first Stars living for only a few millions of years at the beginning of the universe to the ultra low mass Frozen Stars expected to linger on into its Twilight they are a bounty of possibility even something as simple as a subk met asteroid has its foibles and birth marks pocked by Millennia of travel through interplanetary space but for black holes this turned out not to be true the allowed solutions for black holes were tightly constrained and in fact completely and totally characterized by three properties and three numbers to describe a black hole it was proved you needed only a mass an electric charge and an angular momentum and that was it that was all nothing else no more parameters existed three numbers gave you everything as the American physicist John Wheeler neatly summarized black holes have no hair and so every black hole in the universe could be classified in terms of its mass its charge and its Spin and nothing more yet behind the mask of the Horizon there are an almost infinite number of ways that a black hole could have been formed and so how do all these starting possibilities end up as just three numbers let me count the ways when a physicist hears these words they immediately feel connected to an apparently totally different part of physics that of thermodynamics the science of heat temperature and entropy imagine you were sat in an airplane the cabin you are in is filled with air gas at a certain temperature and pressure we can feel both properties we sense hot or cold blasts of air and likewise feel in our ears the change in cabin pressure when the airplane descends yet we don't feel the individual atoms that make up this gas within the gas filling any space an almost uncountably large but still finite number of molecules bounce into and off each other so many that ponderous great lumps of Flesh such as ourselves cannot resolve the individual atoms when we talk about a conservatory on a hot summer's day we say simply that it is hot we do not say that the gas molecules in it are moving faster even if we are dimly aware that underneath the concept of heat lies a micro description in terms of atoms moving faster and carrying more energy and so gases have temperature and pressure black holes have m Spin and charge for both physical systems we characterize them with a few numbers for both physical systems these numbers hide an internal cornicopia of States arrangements and possibilities and there is a particular quantity associated with any physical system which counts the number of such internal states that it has and this quantity is the entropy the entropy of a system depends on the bulk per parameters for example the temperature and pressure for a gas for any given value of these parameters it counts the number of internal micro configurations that can give rise to them the more micro configurations consistent with the bulk parameters the higher the entropy the entropy of a gas measures the total number of ways the molecules can be pinging around internally the vast number of ways that the gas's atoms can be moving given a fixed bulk pressure and temperature this entropy the number of internal Arrangements increases with the temperature of the gas higher temperatures represent the case when molecules all go that little bit faster and carry that little bit more energy given all the many directions atoms can move in there are simply more ways of moving faster than there are of moving slower as an example of this we can see that in the limit of the slowest movement of all where speeds vanish entirely an exactly stationary particle has only one way to move the null [Music] motion but can these concepts of thermodynamics familiar from gases and rubber bands really apply to black holes one of the deadest objects in physics remarkably the answer is yes even though there are no atoms whizzing around inside black holes the thermodynamic Concepts still apply just as we can talk about the temperature or entropy of a gas so indeed can we talk about them for a black hole this discovery dated back to the early 1970s first suggested by Jacob beckenstein and later fully developed by Steven Hawking beckenstein had been the graduate student of John Wheeler discussing with beckenstein wheeler had noted that when he mixed hot tea with cold tea the overall entropy would increase in a manner that could never be undone but if the mixed cup subsequently fell into a black hole all evidence of this mixing would then vanish as everything was swallowed up by the black hole into the fixed unique black hole solution and so this set beckenstein thinking could it really be the case that the mixing between hot and cold tea would increase the overall entropy of the universe but when the tea was thrown into the black hole all the entropy of the tea would be lost this seemed impossible indeed the idea went against the almost sacred second law of Thermodynamics that the entropy of the entire universe must increase over time this is one of the most treasured ideas in all of physics indeed Arthur Edington famous for his work on relativity and nuclear fusion was once quoted as saying the law that entropy always increases holds I think the supreme position among the laws of nature if someone points out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell's equations then so much the worse for Maxwell's equations if it's found to be contradicted by observation well those experimentalists do bungle things sometimes but if your theory is found to be against the second law of Thermodynamics I can give you no hope there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation and so perhaps thought beckenstein that just as each cup of tea had an entropy and the overall entropy of the pair increased when the two were mixed the same should be true of the black hole when the cup of tea was thrown into the black hole this would therefore just increase the total entropy of the black hole by one cup of tea and it was this that led beckenstein to the remarkable conclusion that black holes should indeed have an entropy now called the beckenstein Hawking entropy it was a truly bizarre Discovery but what did it mean [Music] which is the hottest black hole in the universe since the first discoveries of astrophysical black holes in the 1960s a wide variety of them have been found and their masses vary hugely the heaviest known black holes such as Phoenix a or ton 618 are around 100 billion times heavier than the mass of the Sun these are Ultra massive black holes at the centers of enormous active galaxies capable of spectacular energies with their superpowered quazar Jets the lightest known black holes however detected as dark orbital companions to other stars or pulsars are only a few times heavier than our sun candidates for the latest known black hole are the orbital Companions of either the PSR j514 42e or the red giant v723 but bizarrely these miniature black holes are a billion times hotter than the distant Giants although with a temperature little more than 100 millionth of a degree hotter here is strictly relative and so black hole temperatures are tiny but they're not zero where does this heat come from by the early 1970s beckenstein and Hawking had ascertained that black holes should have an entropy times Arrow the second law of Thermodynamics continued to point forward fire particles at the black hole and as they fell in the entropy of the particles should be transferred to that of the black hole the overall entropy of the universe would increase and the laws of physics would be satisfied or so it seemed for as he thought about it in more detail Hawking's remarkable mind latched onto a problem with this picture imagine a hot gas falling into a black hole and being entirely absorbed the resulting black hole it was thought should be cold dark and compact nothing should come out it seemed to be a zero temperature object in every other part of physics when hot and cold objects are mixed the temperature of the cold object is increased by the mixing yet here the black holes seem to remain inert with a temperature of absolute zero indeed this was the whole idea of a black hole not even light could Escape but this was where Hawking came in with a striking and surprising idea doubling down on the notion of black holes as thermodynamic objects with an entropy he proposed that black holes also have a temperature not a mathematical analogy to temperature not a gravitational equivalent to temperature but an ordinary temperature with exactly the same meaning as that we use to talk about ovens boiling water and the weather the most exotic objects in the universe suddenly became eerily [Music] familiar the classical laws of thermodynamics dating back to the 19th century relate entropy to temperature in particular they say that the temperature of an object is the inverse of the rate of change of its entropy with energy this this means that for a gas when extra energy is injected the number of gas configurations increases by calculating this precisely we can work out the temperature of the gas but for Black Hole the entropy is actually set by the area of the Horizon in the simplest case of the spart Shield solution this entropy behaves as the square of the mass energy of the black hole plugging this relation into the classical 19th century thermodynamic expression for temperature gives a striking result the black hole must have a temperature and this temperature changes inversely with the mass energy of the black hole big black holes are cold small black holes are hot the temperature of a typical astrophysical black hole in our galaxy formed by a collapsing star and with a mass slightly larger than our sun is around a billionth of a degree however a much smaller and hypothetical as far as we know black hole formed by compressing something like Mount Everest down to a point would have a temperature of hundreds of billions of degrees vastly hotter than the center of each of the largest stars and so this unusual property means that black holes behave in a way opposite to our intuitions a normal fire starts off warm and hot as it gives off heat it cools and eventually there is little more than a small glow From the Ashes which eventually dies away to nothing black holes on the other hand become hotter as they give off heat while the black hole starts cold it it gets hotter as it loses energy eventually evaporating in a blaze of radiation strange but characteristic of black holes and so as we begin to unravel what this means let's start with the simplest question why do black holes have a temperature hot objects radiate place your hand near a fire or an oven and you will feel the heat without ever touching it indeed precisely what it means for something to be hot is that it transfers heat to something that is cold place the two objects next to each other and they equilibrate at an intermediate temperature as heat goes from the hot body to the cold body but black holes we thought were not meant to give out anything were they not introduced as voids in space which may eat and swallow and Gobble dragging all they consume towards some unknown singularity but do not spit anything out this after all is what the black in black hole refers to they absorb light but do not Emit and yet with the Revelation that they had entropy this was found to be not quite true indeed if we could place our hand close to a black hole with a temperature of 1,000° the experience ought to be identical to placing our hand close to an oven with a temperature of 1,000° just as our hand feels the photons from the oven striking our skin and transferring energy to the skin cells which is then communicated to our brain via nerve impulses so too a hand must feel photons from the black hole striking the skin and transferring heat to it but where would these photons come from for this to be true there must be actual particles coming out of the black hole not just falling into it in the 1970s this seemed absurd completely inconsistent with the whole idea of what a black hole actually was could there really be particles coming out of a black hole remarkably the answer was yes of Steven Hawkings many contributions to physics this result is the most important and the most enduring the light that emerges from a black hole is called Hawking radiation and it emerges with precisely the Spectrum you would expect given the temperature of the black hole Hawking radiation is theoretically well established and has been derived using many different approaches but what all the approaches have in common is that they sit at the intersection of the physics of gravity black holes and quantum mechanics and to understand this we have to begin by thinking about Heisenberg's uncertainty principle the idea that there is never a perfectly still vacuum in quantum mechanics nothing can can be settled down completely or more accurately nothing empty space can't be settled down completely imagine yourself close to but just outside the Horizon of a black hole if you were to cross the Horizon you would fall into the black hole and your fate would be sealed irrevocably but instead suppose you have a rocket with enormously powerful engines which are strong enough just strong enough to prevent you from falling into the black hole the engines fire constantly and you remain just outside the Horizon now imagine two beacons on the rocket one on the side towards the black hole Horizon and one on the side away from it light emitted from The Horizon side Beacon immediately crosses the Horizon and Falls never to return into the black hole Singularity light emitted from the other Beacon however pointed away from the black hole succeeds in escaping the black hole and reaching deep space far away from it this is similar to how Hawking radiation Works contained within Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is the idea that in quantum mechanics even the coldest and emptiest vacuum is not empty there is an intrinsic energy associated with this vacuum and it's even possible to borrow this energy for a short period of time the more energy you want to borrow the shorter the time period you're allowed to borrow it for this means that for very short periods of time the vacuum can borrow sufficient energy to create albeit temporarily particle anti-particle pairs provided these are rapidly reabsorbed back again into the vacuum and their energy returned no harm is done to the laws of physics and the law of conservation of energy although this may seem strange this is one of the key examples of the complexity of the vacuum in quantum mechanics nothing is far from straightforward but sitting on top of this is the fact that this vacuum is not just empty space extending in directions here we are considering space just outside the Horizon of the black hole with the gravitational pull of the black hole always ready to take objects through the Horizon this vacuum comes with a direction inwards attached what happens then just outside the Horizon when energy is borrowed from the vacuum to create particle antiparticle pairs or for particles like the photon which is his own antiparticle a pair of two backto back photons well for a short instance of time one can borrow energy to create a pair of photons and for that same incredibly short instant these particles can travel and during this incredibly short instant one of the pair crosses the Horizon the oneway portal towards the singularity and so the pair can no longer come back [Music] together just as our rocket teetering on the edge of the Abyss fires photons both into and out of the black hole so in a sense does the quantum vacuum while one particle or anti-particle escapes off into Infinity the other falls into the black hole and the borrowed vacuum energy now has to be repaid by the black hole the net result is that one particle or antiparticle escapes taking a tiny bit of energy with it and this energy is repay by the black hole losing a tiny bit of its mass energy detailed calculations confir confirmed Hawking's intuition that this process looks a lot like a hot oven radiating light Hawking radiation is usually photons as they are massless and can escape the gravity of the black hole and so there it was Steven Hawking found that black holes were not black but again that was not the end as ever with black holes solving one problem introduced another because if you waited long enough the black hole would eventually evaporate away entirely there would be no interior of the black hole anymore we can imagine a history that starts before the black hole is formed with countless encyclopedias and databases falling in under Gravity to create the black hole over time the black hole evaporates and at the end there is a gas of particles heading out from where the black hole once was and so what has happened to all the information that was once there according to Hawkings calculation the emitted radiation was that of a perfectly featureless thermal Spectrum which contained no trace of the original information where had it all gone could the information be reconstructed from the details of the emitted radiation for two decades this question was debated in ordinary quantum mechanics information is not lost were black holes like this or did the unusual combination of gravity and quantum mechanics lead to some fundamental differences eventually the answer came from an unexpected Direction the fact that the entropy was proportional to the area not the volume of the black hole this was the first sign of a deep and subtle idea called the holographic principle with huge consequences for the universe [Music] imagine you've dropped a book into a black hole how you do this somehow withstanding the brutal accretion disc and waves of radiation is unimportant the key thing is somehow you do we can imagine the book falling until it reaches the central gravitational singularity at the very heart of the black hole where any information that it carries is crushed utterly and so to understand whether or not the information is destroyed or survives it seems we would need to understand this Central Singularity what is the interior of a black hole like does information survive in a theory of quantum gravity if we recorded the details of every Photon emitted from the black hole through Hawking radiation would we in principle be able to reconstruct the information most of the ideas that we've discussed so far the existence and entropy of black holes as well as Hawking radiation are however exciting still ideas which had been mostly worked out by the end of the 1970s but over the following years physicists have realized that the physics of black holes contains even more the first hints of even deeper and stranger truths in particular the physics of black holes gave us the first glimpse of one of the most remarkable and shocking properties of gravity the holographic principle and it is this holographic principle that offers the best framework to think about what happens to the information lost to a black hole to begin with let's return to Hawking's formula for the entropy of a black hole there's part of this which may not appear unusual but is in fact the first indication of something groundbreaking the entropy of a black hole grows with its area and not with its volume physicists knew that the mass of a black hole is equivalent to the area of its Event Horizon the geometric area of the surrounding spherically symmetric shell inside which nothing can escape for the simplest fart Shield black hole this Horizon area depends simply on the mass of the black hole but for spinning black holes the expression of the Horizon area was more complex and depended on both the mass and spin rate of the black hole but by 1971 it was Steven Hawking who had shown that whatever happened to a black hole even including complicated processes which could extract angular momentum from a spinning black hole actually slowing its Spin The Horizon area would only increase and in the second law of Thermodynamics it is entropy that can only increase first beckenstein and then Hawking realized that it was the Horizon area not the mass or the volume or the angular momentum which behaved in precisely the way that entropy was meant to behave when objects fall into a black hole adding to the information and therefore entropy inside the black hole The Horizon area of the black hole increases when two black holes merge The Horizon area of the product black hole is larger than either of its components in complicated slingshots which could extract both mass and angular momentum from a black hole the black hole Mass decreases but the Horizon area increases but why is this surprising black holes as we have seen are similar to gases in some respects they're both thermodynamic objects with temperatures and entropies like hot gases hot black holes give off radiation however there is an important and subtle way in which they are [Music] different the entropy of any object is a measure of the total number of internal configurations that an object can have a measure of the number of ways of rearranging the inerts while keeping the external properties the same for gas the entropy grows with the volume of the gas if you imagine a balloon at a certain pressure and we hold the pressure the same the bigger the volume of the balloon the more the number of possible allowed internal configurations of the gas and so suppose we divide up the entire volume of the gas into lots of little blocks little unit volumes of space each of these volumes could be either on or off perhaps on means a gas particle is in the volume and off means it's not with one block there would be two choices for two blocks there would be two squared for three blocks two cubed for 100 blocks we multiply two by 100 times generally the number of total configurations is two raised to the power of the number of blocks and so what is different about black holes well for black black holes the beckenstein Hawking entropy depended on the area of the black hole Horizon and not on the volume in terms of our picture of little blocks Each of which can either be a one or a zero what this formula implied is that for black holes we could count the number of internal configurations by splitting the Horizon area into many small little blocks the counting process looks similar to what we did for gases but only provided we do the counting on the horizon of the black hole and not on the interior volume and this is the holographic principle the statement that for many gravitational systems the physics of the system is entirely encoded on the boundary of the system the equations for gravity in the interior can be Rewritten or translated into a different set of equations which describes a non-gravitational theory that lives only on this boundary gravitational systems in a three-dimensional space can be equivalent to non-gravitational systems on the two-dimensional boundary gravitational systems in a five-dimensional space can be equivalent to non-gravitational systems on the four-dimensional boundary gravitational systems that live in a certain amount of dimensions are equivalent to non-gravitational systems that live in one less one of the dimensions in the gravitational Theory turns out to be redundant this concept also called today the ads CFT correspondence is one of the deepest ideas in modern theoretical physics and is supported by a vast number of calculations the key claim is that two separate mathematical theories a gravitational theory in say five dimensions and a non-gravitational quantum theory in four dimensions are actually identical theories just written in very different language indeed this has been moted as a way to link the previously incompatible gravity and quantum mechanics the Holy Grail of modern physics and it was the beckenstein Hawking expression for the entropy of the black hole that represented the first inkling of this Theory but how does holography help with the information Paradox where has all the information gone holography tells us that a gravitational system and its Evolution can be described through an alternative non-gravitational language suppose a gravitational system with an alternative non-gravitational holographic description has a black hole which forms and evaporates in the context of the gravitational Theory we would worry that the information is lost but in the alternative holographic lower dimensional description the process of formation and evaporation of the black hole occurs in a completely non-gravitational l language here it is simply an ordinary quantum mechanical system evolving in an ordinary quantum mechanical fashion and there are no problems involving singularities or Horizons in such an ordinary Quantum system there is no question of information loss the information is simply kept on the horizon stored on a lower dimensional boundary but still even if we know that the information will be preserved where is it exactly the best answer yet is that it will lie in the details of the Hawking radiation although we may think of the radiation as being emitted from the black hole like an oven all uncorrelated with each other this is not quite correct instead some physicists believe all the emitted photons are subtly correlated and entangled with each other and it is here that lies the information that fell into the black hole and so black holes are truly bizarre objects that challenge our very Notions of what information and reality are but what are they made of once they are formed and before they evaporate are we able to say what a black hole actually is for gas the microscopic configuration involves the locations and speeds of all the atoms that make up the gas what is the analog for black holes such a question is not easy and seemingly impossible to test experimentally to access the innards of a black hole and see just what it's made of our hypothetical rocket leaden with future technology must first cross the black hole Horizon but of course having done so the rocket can never again leave the black hole and so whatever nuggets of knowledge it may find can never be sent back to those scientists who remain outside so the Interiors of real black holes many light years distant and with their interior hidden by The Horizon are beyond our current reach both in practice and in principle but mathematics can reach where Rockets cannot if we can't do physical experiments the next best thing is to do thought experiments or mathematical calculations of systems that do not precisely describe our real world but instead describe ideal systems which share Key Properties with our real world and so are there mathema iCal examples which capture some of the physics of real world black holes but have enough Symmetry and control to enable us to do the calculation in some cases the answer is yes in a famous 1995 calculation Andrew strominger and KRON vafer both of Harvard University studied a highly stylized example of five-dimensional black holes in string theory these black holes are mathematical they exist in a world with one extra spatial Dimension compared to our own they were also very specific they came with a package of extra symmetries and properties that do not hold for the ordinary black holes present in our universe but for these extra special black holes struminger and vafa were able to count and determine precisely the possible inner micro states that corresponded to a black hole solution all the inner stuff that could make up the black hole in this specific example the answer involved extended String Theory objects called brains counting all the ways these could be put together they obtained an answer that precisely agreed with the calculation of Hawking although it was a calculation for a mathematical Universe with extra dimensions and extra symmetries this was still a calculation and a result in this simplified situation they were able to understand exactly the entropy formula for a black hole from a microscopic perspective and count up all the states that could make up the black hole unfortunately however for real world black holes we are still waiting for answers what lies inside actual black holes such as signus a or ton 618 we don't know and cannot yet say what their internal micro states are or how their Interiors are precisely captured by physics on their Horizon but ideas such as the holographic principle give us the hope that one day perhaps we will catch a glimpse inside but maybe not until further surprises from these mysterious objects at the intersection of gravity astrophysics and quantum mechanics and so still almost 300 years after they were first proposed nothing in the universe is as mysterious as a black hole you've been

﻿“You must not attempt this approach 
to parallels. I have traversed this   bottomless night, which extinguished all 
light and joy in my life. I entreat you,   leave the science of parallels alone…”
Two trains hurtle along tracks side by   Two trains hurtle along tracks side by side, straining every rivet and bolt. It’s neck and neck, one locomotive inching in front of the other, before conceding ground. Crowds line the sidings, waving flags and cheering for their favourite engine in this unusual race.
Then the unthinkable happens.
  Gasps ring out as the trains smash 
into each other, metal folding like   paper as they burst into flames.  But how could this have happened? After all, the tracks the trains were racing 
along were parallel. The very definition of   parallel lines is that they will never 
meet, no matter how far you extend them.
  How could they have come together?
Mathematicians have studied parallel lines   for millennia. Among the earliest to juggle with 
these ideas was the Greek polymath, Euclid - often   referred to as the Father of Geometry. Euclid 
penned one of the most influential books ever   written, Elements - containing many of the 
rules that underpin mathematics to this day.
  And the fifth of these rules is 
called the parallel postulate.
  This effectively states that two trains travelling 
along parallel tracks should never, ever meet. The   other four postulates were quickly proven, 
but the parallel postulate remained evasive,   unproven for almost two thousand years.
Until finally, in the 19th century,   mathematicians dropped an existential bombshell.
The postulate hadn't been proven   because it couldn't be.
Two parallel lines could meet after all.
  Suddenly, Euclidean geometry was 
no longer the only game in town.
  It became possible to bend and contort space 
in ways that completely upend the usual   rules. Indeed, among those who broke Euclid’s 
parallel postulate was Hungarian mathematician   night that extinguished all joy in his life.
But what does this mean? And why does   this matter outside of mathematics?
The answer, as we will see, is truly bizarre.
  For today, non-Euclidean geometry lies at the 
heart of one of the most fundamental questions   in the universe. A cosmic question close to the 
top of the list of those asked to astronomers.
  Our journey towards answering this question 
will take us to bizarre, twisted universes   where light loops round and we can see the same 
galaxies multiple times in the sky. It will guide   us through universes folded back on themselves, 
universes where if you look hard enough you may   see yourself staring back - and universes where 
parallel lines meet again and again and again.
  It is a trip that will defy common sense, but 
is guaranteed to leave you with a much deeper   understanding of the cosmos in which we live - 
and possibly even which cosmos in which we live.
  And the question we will be answering?
  If the universe is expanding, just 
what is it expanding into...?
  On the 27th of December 2024, a telescope in 
Chile discovered something that caused the   UN to activate a planetary defence 
protocol for the very first time.
  The telescope had discovered 2024 YR4, an 
asteroid the size of a football field, that   if it hits Earth in 2032 will unleash hundreds 
of times more energy than the Hiroshima bomb.   But the question is - will it?
With breaking news like this,   especially science breaking news, which is 
very susceptible to hyperbole, it is hugely   important to know where your information is 
coming from, which is why I use Ground News   as an indispensable resource when researching, and 
they've kindly helped make this video possible.
  Ground News gathers the world’s news in one 
place so you can compare coverage and verify   your information. For the 2032 asteroid, it 
lists 224 news sources all on one handy page,   and rates each publication for bias 
and factuality, as well as providing   information about the publication's ownership.
For example, one source listed as 'mixed   factuality' originally ran with the headline 
'Graphic shows asteroid the size of a football   pitch on course to hit Earth' whereas most 
of the sources listed as high or very high   factuality were more up front that the chances 
of impact with earth are only between 1 and 2%.

  In Medieval Naples, Pope Innocent IV lies 
on his sickbed. The Pontiff's advisors have   just delivered the crushing news that his 
Papal forces have been overrun by Manfred,   the King of Sicily. This devastating development 
is widely credited as the reason for his   death just days later at the age of 59.
And yet, in some circles at least, there are   growing whispers that the Pope's early demise came 
from an entirely different source. That he was,   in fact, murdered. The proposed culprit? 
The ghost of a little known English bishop   with whom he'd clashed time and time again.
A clergyman by the name of Robert Grosseteste.
  This supposed spiritual assassin was born in the 
13th century and rose to become the bishop of the   English cathedral city of Lincoln. Quarrelsome and 
restless, he sought reforms to the Catholic Church   that would bring him into direct conflict with 
Pope Innocent IV as well as King Henry III.  
  Yet it is Grossteste's contributions to 
the fledgling field of modern science   that are far more noteworthy.
For he was a particularly early   advocate of the scientific method - and the 
crucial role of experiment in revealing the   hidden laws that invisibly govern our world.
To begin with, Grossteste was the first person   in history to correctly explain rainbows as 
the result of the refraction of light. And   light became somewhat of an obsession and played 
a central role in his version of something bishops   and cosmologists both fixate on: the creation 
of the universe. According to Grossteste, the   universe began when light expanded outwards from 
a central point, before condensing into matter.   This was a full seven centuries before modern 
astronomers would hit upon a similar notion.
  And so today, Grosseteste is known in 
some circles as the “Big Bang bishop”. 
  Grossteste died in 1253 and is buried in Lincoln 
cathedral. Miracles were reported at his shrine   and he was widely considered a saint in England 
as a result. Although Grosseteste’s sainthood was   never ratified by the Vatican, in large part due 
to the rumour that his ghost murdered the Pope.
  But as we know Grosseteste´s idea for an 
expanding universe would not be developed   in the following years - it would take more than 
half a millenia for it to raise its head again.
  And interestingly, it was another Catholic 
man of the cloth that would ultimately   rekindle Grossteste's idea in the early 20th 
century: the Belgian priest Georges Lemaître. 
  Lemaître was lucky to even be alive at 
this point. As an artillery officer at   Ypres during the First World War, he narrowly 
escaped the horrors of a cloud of chlorine gas   when the wind changed direction and blew it 
away from him. Then, in the Second World War,   the Americans accidentally bombed his home.
In 1927, Lemaître published his solutions to   the equations of Einstein's General Theory of 
Relativity, our best and most complete theory   of gravity. He wasn´t the first to do this - 
people had been doing it for years - indeed   Karl Schwarzschild had been one of the 
first more than a decade earlier, using   his solution to propose the idea of a black hole.
Lemaître's solutions however were different - they   implied that the entire universe was expanding.
But most ignored his findings. Einstein was among   those who were brutally dismissive: 
“Your calculations are correct,   but your physics is abominable,” he said. 
Einstein famously would go on to tweak his   own equations to maintain a static universe. 
However, the seeds of the proof that Lemaître   was right – and Einstein wrong - had already been 
sown - for in 1915, the American astronomer Vesto   Slipher had announced his discovery that 
galaxies appear to be running away from  us.  
And Slipher reached his landmark conclusion thanks   to measurements of redshift, one of the most 
important weapons in an astronomer's armoury.
  First, take light from a galaxy and break 
it up into its constituent colours - much   like Grosseteste correctly assumed 
raindrops do to create rainbows. Second,   look for the dark bands hidden in this spectrum 
that represent missing colours swallowed by the   various chemical elements that make up the 
galaxy. Finally, measure how far this pattern   of lines has been shunted towards the red end of 
the spectrum. The more pronounced this “redshift”,   the faster the galaxy is receding from us.
This was only one half of the puzzle, however.   The final, missing piece would be provided by 
Edwin Hubble in 1929. He measured the distances   to galaxies, before comparing them to the speeds 
with which the galaxies are fleeing. In doing   so he found a very strict pattern now known as 
Hubble’s Law. The further a galaxy is from us,   the faster it appears to be running away. 
How fast? According to modern measurements,   about 23 kilometres per second 
for every million light years.  
  And so Hubble immediately knew that Lemaître 
was right. The universe is expanding after all,   just as the visionary Grossteste 
had suspected centuries before.
  Despite how often it is talked about, it's 
not always immediately obvious why the   fact that more distant galaxies are fleeing 
from us faster automatically means that the   universe must be expanding. So let's nail 
the link with a more familiar example   of something else that expands: bread.
Bread with raisins in it - to be precise.
  Imagine mixing and kneading the dough, before 
placing it in the oven for an hour to bake. In   that time it will double in size to give you a 
tasty treat. But now imagine placing yourself on   one of the raisins and looking around you 
at the other raisins as the dough rises.
  A raisin that was initially one centimetre away 
from you will end up two centimetres away at the   end of the baking time. It will have moved one 
centimetre in an hour. If a raisin was already   two centimetres away from you to begin with then 
it will end up four centimetres away, moving at   an apparent speed of two centimetres per hour. 
A third raisin initially three centimetres away   would finish the bake six centimetres distant, 
apparently moving at three centimetres per hour.
  In other words, the bigger the initial gap between 
you and raisin, the faster you’ll see it move away   from you. Why? Because the dough is expanding. 
It is not that the raisins are moving through   the dough. Nor is more dough somehow being added. 
Instead the gap between the raisins is stretched   by the existing dough’s expansion. The more dough 
there was between you and a raisin to begin with,   the more pronounced the effect of its expansion.
Hubble’s Law offers up an identical explanation   for galaxies. As Slipher realised, most appear 
to be running away from us, but the galaxies   themselves aren’t fleeing through space. Instead, 
the space between the galaxies is expanding and   carrying them ever further from us. The more 
space there was to begin with - in other words   the further a galaxy is from us - the faster it 
will appear to move away. No new space is being   added, merely existing space stretched. This 
is allowed by General Relativity - space and   time are malleable, inconstant things. And it is the expansion of the universe that is 
also responsible for the more pronounced redshift   of more distant galaxies spotted by Slipher. 
As the light waves travelled towards Earth,   they were stretched as the space they travelled 
through expanded. Of all the colours of the   rainbow, red light has the longest waves. The 
more space the light had to travel through to   get here, the closer to the red end of the 
spectrum the spectral lines will appear. 
  This is a good illustration of another subtle 
point that often vexes people when it comes   to fully understanding an expanding universe. 
People often ask about what happens to energy   as the universe expands. Energy conservation 
is one of the most famous laws of physics,   stating that energy can't be created or 
destroyed and that the total energy of   a system must stay the same. However, energy 
is not conserved in an expanding universe. 
  The energy conservation rule holds for 
the kind of physics covered by Isaac   Newton's three famous laws of motion where 
particles move through a benign background   space that isn't changing. However, space is 
constantly changing in an expanding universe   and so the total energy of the particles moving 
through it is not conserved in the same way.
  Redshifted light is a perfect example. As the 
expansion stretches out the light waves, they   lose energy. The total energy of all the photons 
reaching Earth decreases, it is not conserved. 
  And this expansion of the universe also 
leads to another curious effect. Light   from the most ancient events takes longer 
to arrive as it has had to travel a long   way through an expanding universe to get here. 
The result is that the oldest objects in the   universe appear to evolve almost five times 
more slowly than the same events today. 
  The fact that the universe is expanding is clear, 
but when exactly did this expansion start? Well,   if the universe is getting bigger day by day 
then it was smaller yesterday. It was smaller   still a century ago and yet more minuscule 
nearly a millennium ago when Grossteste’s   ghost was supposedly seeing-off the Pope.
And so how far back does this expansion go?
  It is Hubble's Law that tells us how 
much expansion there has been since the   Big Bang. Rewinding the clock on this 
expansion tells us when the expansion   started. At this earliest moment in 
the universe's history, every part of   the modern cosmos was concentrated down into 
an infinitely small speck. This little piece   of nothingness is what Lemaître 
called the “Primeval Atom” - today,   astronomers call it the Big Bang. And rewinding 
Hubble’s Law timestamps the beginning of this   expansion at around 13.8 billion years ago.  The very name of the   event - The Big Bang - calls to mind some kind of 
explosion, one that continues to drive the ongoing   expansion of the universe even to this day. 
Understandably, people then ask astronomers   for the location of the explosion. To point them 
to the place in the universe where the Big Bang   banged. Where is the centre of the universe? 
After all, if a bomb exploded in a room then   investigators sent in in the aftermath could piece 
together the necessary clues from the shrapnel and   debris to work out where in the room the bomb went 
off. So why can’t the same be done with the Big   Bang? Well, the Big Bang created the universe. If 
a bomb exploded, and in doing so created a room,   then it would make no sense to ask where 
in that room the bomb detonated. After all,   the room didn’t exist before the explosion.   In an expanding   universe everyone thinks that they 
are at the centre of the expansion,   when in fact there is no centre at all. 
And so - It's clear that the universe isn’t   expanding from anywhere, but then what is it 
expanding into? It is one of the other questions   most frequently asked of astronomers, but also one 
that turns out to be trickier to answer than it   first appears, with deep and profound consequences 
for the way we understand the universe…
  The view is magnificently monochrome as 
you hurtle high above the surface of the   Moon. Prehistoric craters, smooth lava plains, 
soaring mountains and spindly volcanic rilles   jut and spread for as far as the eye can see. An 
ancient, empty wasteland touched only by twelve   pairs of American boots in billions of years.
Flying over the jagged lunar landscape is more   than just breathtaking. It is also a journey 
through the history of science. You’ll find   crater after crater named after the most towering 
figures ever to contemplate the cosmos. Indeed,   this roll-call of celestial greatness includes 
Einstein, Hubble, Slipher and Lemaître. 
  And it also includes two craters that sit 
on opposite sides of the Moon - one on the   northern nearside and the other on the southern 
far side. Their geographical juxtaposition is apt   because the two physicists they are named after 
- Wilhelm de Sitter and Hermann Minkowski - also   lend their names to opposing possibilities 
for the shape of our universe. Which one   turns out to be correct governs whether 
or not the cosmos will ever end - and   has important consequences for our question of 
what exactly the universe is expanding into. 
  Minkowski was once Einstein's professor. 
They didn't always see eye to eye,   however. “He's a lazy dog who never bothered 
about mathematics at all,” Minkowski once said   of the most famous scientist who has ever lived. 
Indeed, Minkowski was far closer to the legendary   German mathematician David Hilbert, who wrote 
a touching obituary of his friend. Referring   to their shared scientific work, Hilbert said: 
“It seemed to us a garden full of flowers. In it,   we enjoyed looking for hidden pathways 
and discovered many a new perspective that   appealed to our sense of beauty, and when one 
of us showed it to the other and we marvelled   over it together, our joy was complete.”
de Sitter, on the other hand, was born in   1872 to a judge, the latest in a long line 
of lawyers stretching back generations.   However, Wilhelm would abandon enforcing 
the rule of law for a chance to understand   the hidden rules of the universe. When he died of 
pneumonia in 1934, the New Times wrote of him: 
  “He is not a cold, dispassionate juggler of Greek 
letters, a balancer of equations, but rather an   artist... Only the musician can fully grasp what 
it must have meant to de Sitter to see the cosmos   shaping itself in new ways in his formulas.”
And it is for their work on the overall shape   of the universe that the two men 
are most remembered today.
  Minkowski space and de Sitter space 
are different ways to describe the   way in which the fabric of the universe curves.
Minkowski space is usually referred to as ‘flat’,   which is not intuitively the clearest way 
to describe it - because to astronomers   and mathematicians, ‘flat’ doesn’t 
necessarily mean two dimensional like   a flat sheet. Instead it refers to space that 
has zero intrinsic curvature. Indeed, shortly   we’ll encounter multiple examples of ‘flat’ 
shapes that are very much three dimensional.
  Shapes drawn in Minkowski space follow 
the rules of Euclidean geometry,   named after the Ancient Greek mathematician 
Euclid. Euclidean geometry may sound unfamiliar,   but it is the bedrock of high school mathematics. 
Triangles drawn in Minkowski space, for example,   have angles that add up to 180 degrees, just 
as our teachers repeatedly tried to drum into   us. Parallel lines stay parallel - forever.
What your teachers probably didn’t tell you,   though, is that this isn’t true for all triangles. 
And to see why, let’s return to the Moon…
  Imagine yourself atop the lunar North Pole. 
You travel down towards the lunar equator,   crossing the de Sitter crater on the way. Upon 
reaching the equator you take a 90 degree turn,   travel along the equator for a while, then 
take another 90 degree turn that sets you   back on a path back to your starting point 
on the North Pole. Your entire journey traces   out a triangle across the craggy lunar surface.
However, the base of this triangle already has two   angles each equal to 90 degrees. The other angle 
at the North Pole is not zero and so the angles   in this triangle must add up to more than 180 
degrees. In fact, it is possible for a triangle   drawn on a sphere to contain up to 540 degrees.
This is an example of non-Euclidean geometry. A   similarly shaped universe is referred to as 
closed. Just like circumnavigating the Moon   or the Earth, even if you travel in a straight 
line you’ll still eventually loop back round and   return to where you started. Space with positive 
curvature is also known as de Sitter space. 
  There is a third possibility, however: anti de 
Sitter space. In this version of non-Euclidean   geometry, the angles in a triangle add up to fewer 
than 180 degrees. This is due to the negative   curvature of the space, similar to the shape of a 
saddle or even a Pringles chip. A universe shaped   like this is referred to as open. The negative 
curvature 'pinches' the angles of the triangle,   causing them to sum to less than 180 degrees.
So of this trio of options, which kind of   universe do we live in? Open, closed, or flat? 
  We can imagine a spaceship tracing a 
giant triangle in the sky in an attempt   to answer this question. They could fly for 
millions of light years across the universe,   before returning to the Earth - a mega version 
of the triangle we drew on the lunar surface. 
  If, like on the Moon, they needed to turn through 
more than 180 degrees to complete the triangle,   we’d conclude that the universe is positively 
curved. If they managed to pull it off by   travelling through fewer than 180 degrees then 
that would indicate negative curvature. Only   if their triangular path contained exactly 
180 degrees would the universe be flat.
  Unfortunately, no astronauts have yet ventured 
further than the Moon and even our most distant   spacecraft won’t reach the nearest stars for 
tens of thousands of years. Let alone leaving the   galaxy and flying for millions of light years.
Thankfully, there is something else that has   already travelled across the universe for 
billions of light years: the light from   the Cosmic Microwave Background, the leftover 
radiation from near the birth of the universe.
  Look at a map of the Cosmic Microwave 
Background and it is speckled with tiny   temperature variations. Small regions a little 
hotter or cooler than the average. They correspond   to areas of the baby universe that were a little 
denser or sparser. These regions were the seeds   from which structure in the adolescent universe 
emerged. Denser regions gradually pulled in   more material to construct huge superclusters of 
galaxies. Empty regions became larger as a result,   fashioning enormous supervoids.
Knowing the expansion history of   the universe from Hubble’s Law, astronomers 
can work backwards from the megastructures in   the modern universe to predict the size 
of the speckles in the CMB. The answer   they get matches their observations perfectly. 
And this tells us that the light from the CMB has   travelled through a flat universe to reach us, 
one governed by the rules of Minkowski space.
   
Next, astronomers have to try and work out what's   called the topology of the universe. To 
understand what is meant by topology,   imagine two shapes each made out of modelling 
clay. If you can remould one of the shapes   into the other without tearing the clay then the 
two shapes share the same topology. A doughnut,   for example, is a match for a teacup – 
the hole in the handle of the cup can be   reworked into the hole in the centre of the 
doughnut without needing to make any tears.
  The universe could resemble a giant sheet of 
paper. If you curl that sheet up you get a   cylinder and if you join the ends of the cylinder 
together you get a donut – a shape mathematicians   call a torus. All of these topologies are 
considered flat because the angles in any   triangle drawn on them add up to 180 degrees.
There are, however, a total of 18 different   3D topologies consistent with a flat universe 
that follow the rules of Euclidean geometry. 
  Indeed, by far the simplest option is the 
first: that, like an endless stretched out   piece of paper, the universe just continues 
on and on forever. An infinite universe.   That’s impossible for a closed universe. As 
we’ve seen, you’ll always eventually end up   back where you started and the journey of 
our intrepid explorers would be finite. 
  If the universe is indeed infinite then it 
isn’t expanding into anything. It can’t be   getting bigger to occupy more space as the 
space that’s there is already infinite.
  But is the universe really infinite? 
Not in some of the other topologies that   fit with our observations of the Cosmic 
Microwave Background and the apparent   flatness of the universe. Take one of 
them, a shape known as the 3-torus. 
  Imagine taking an ordinary cube, then bending 
a pair of opposite sides around and gluing them   together. Then do the same for the other two pairs 
of sides. The result is a 3-torus. If the universe   is shaped like this then travelling away from the 
Earth in a straight line would eventually see you   return to the Earth on a finite, closed loop. 
Other flat topologies also have these closed   loops, including the so-called Hantzsche–Wendt 
manifold. It can be constructed by starting with   two cubes stuck together and then bending the 
different faces around to join one another. 
  If the universe really has such closed loops then 
we could be living in a cosmic hall of mirrors.   Light following a closed loop could result in us 
seeing the same object in different parts of the   sky as its light is bent back around. Astronomers 
have looked for repeating, connected patterns in   the Cosmic Microwave Background, but are yet to 
see anything significant. So it remains hard to   say if the universe is infinite or not. 
The Hantzsche–Wendt manifold has received   particular attention because its complex geometry 
would actually obscure the repeating patterns,   which might be why astronomers haven't seen them.
To make matters worse, astronomers aren't even   100 per cent sure that the universe is actually 
flat in the first place. In cosmology this dilemma   has become known as the “flatness problem”. 
Strictly speaking, astronomers have used the   Cosmic Microwave Background to measure the 
flatness of the observable universe – the   bit they are able to see. There is thought to be 
more universe beyond this imaginary boundary.
  This leaves astronomers with two competing 
options. The first is that the entire   universe is flat – the bit they can see 
and the bit that they can't. However,   when astronomers calculate the odds of this 
happening they are astronomically small.
  The alternative is that the Big Bang has 
expanded the universe to such a degree   that any curvature the observable universe 
initially had was ironed out. This is similar   to how the Earth appears to be flat beneath 
your feet, despite the fact that the Earth's   surface is curved. That curvature is only 
noticeable above a certain scale and in the   cosmos that scale could well be beyond 
the edge of the observable universe. 
  Except, Hubble's Law tells us how much expansion 
there has been since the Big Bang 13.8 billion   years ago. And there simply hasn't been enough to 
completely smooth out the observable universe. 
  The most commonly accepted fix to this problem 
is a theory known as cosmic inflation. It   injects a period of super-rapid expansion in the 
universe's first fractions of a second over and   above Hubble's Law. Inflation also explains those 
tiny speckles in the Cosmic Microwave Background,   which shouldn't be there according to the 
original Big Bang theory. According to inflation,   the speckles are the result of tiny quantum 
fluctuations frozen into the universe forever   when it suddenly ballooned in size. But as yet 
there's evidence that this short, sharp period   of Hubble expansion on steroids really happened.
Finding definitive evidence for inflation would   put the possibility of a non-flat and therefore 
finite universe firmly back on the table. Yet   with that the nagging question of what the 
universe is expanding into re-emerges.
  Although, as it turns out, we 
don't necessarily need for it   to be expanding into anything at all…
It is the late 1780s. The United States of   America has yet to reach its teenage years. France 
is about to descend into a chaotic revolution that   would eventually see King Louis XVI meet the 
business end of a guillotine. And meanwhile,   in Germany, a young schoolboy by the name of 
Carl Friedrich Gauss is sitting in a classroom   listening attentively in a mathematics lesson.
The teacher has just set the students a task. They   must add up all the numbers from 1 to 100. Within 
seconds Gauss pipes up: “5050, sir”. The teacher’s   jaw drops faster than a guillo tine blade. 
It is unclear whether this ever really happened.   The story has joined the annals of other 
likely apocryphal tales in the history of   science. Think Archimedes running naked down the 
street or the apple falling on Newton’s head. 
  Indeed, the trick to arriving at 5050 within 
just a few heartbeats is to realise that you   don’t actually have to tediously 
add up all the numbers. Instead,   you pair the numbers off. 1 with 100. 2 with 
99. 3 with 98 and so on. Each pair will always   add together to make 101. With 50 such pairs, all 
the young Gauss had to do was multiply 101 by 50   and arrive at the correct answer of 5050. 
Whether it happened or not, the anecdote is   designed to illustrate Gauss’s precocious talent 
for mathematics, even from a tender age. He would   go on to become one of the most influential - if 
not the most influential - mathematicians of all   time. And Gauss's work would eventually 
become a cornerstone of the way we   understand the universe, what it truly means 
to say that it is expanding and whether or not   it needs to be expanding into anything.
Earlier, we used the analogy of raisin   bread to explain the expanding universe. An 
inflating balloon with coins stuck onto its   surface to represent galaxies is another analogy 
that’s often used. As you blow up the balloon,   the galaxies move further apart as the 
rubber between them stretches. Likewise,   we do not expand with the expanding universe, 
so tight are the shackles of our atomic bonds. 
  However, all of these everyday analogies for 
an expanding universe have their limitations.   In both scenarios the object is still expanding 
into something – either the oven or the room.
  And so to understand how the universe itself can 
expand without needing to expand into anything   at all, we need to enter a baffling branch of 
mathematics known as differential geometry... 
  To begin with, imagine a two dimensional sheet 
that’s then rolled up into a cylinder. To   achieve this you have to curve the sheet 
through a third dimension that's beyond   the sheet itself. Mathematicians call this 
external dimension the embedding space. 
  Now let’s imagine that our universe really is 
shaped like this cylinder and that intrepid   astronauts are tracing a giant triangle across its 
surface. The angles in that triangle would add up   to 180 degrees, just as they would on the original 
flat sheet. From the astronauts' point of view,   they'd be unable to tell the difference 
between the flat sheet and the cylinder. 
  That is unless they could somehow leave the 
surface of the cylinder entirely and look back on   it from the embedding space. Only then could they 
see it was curved. Shapes like this are said to   have extrinsic curvature – the curvature is only 
apparent from beyond the surface of the shape. 
  To say this another way, a cylinder has no 
intrinsic curvature. And in mathematics,   intrinsic curvature is also known as Gaussian 
curvature, because Gauss would make a huge   breakthrough in differential geometry in 1827. 
Shapes with no intrinsic curvature - including   cylinders - are regarded as ‘flat’. 
You can see why it’s a bit confusing. 
  However some shapes do have intrinsic curvature. 
The most obvious example is the sphere. As with   travelling across the moon, you don’t have 
to leave the surface of a sphere in order   to know that it is curved. The fact that 
the angles in a large triangle add up to   more than 180 degrees tells you that you're 
on a curved surface without the need for an   embedding space. When Gauss published the details 
of this idea in 1827 it became known as “Theorema   Egregium” - Latin for “remarkable theory”. 
An interesting consequence of the fact that   a sheet has zero Gaussian curvature, but a 
sphere doesn’t is that all maps of the world   are off. A 2D map of a 3D sphere will always 
be distorted. The most common world maps use   the Mercator projection, which is designed 
to preserve the angles between objects and   make navigation easier. However, that means that 
areas are skewed. Greenland, for example, appears   14 times larger than it really is. There are ways 
to preserve areas and skew angles instead - such   as the Lambert cylindrical equal-area 
projection - but Gauss’s Theorema Egregium   tells us that something always has to give.
But so far we have spoken about hypothetical   cylinders and spheres and maps of the earth - 
what about the real universe in which we live?
  Fast-forward to 1857 and a 76-year-old Gauss 
is the audience for a lecture given by one   of his former protégés: Bernhard Riemann. 
Born in Hanover the year before Gauss published   his Theorema Egregium, Riemann initially set his 
sights on studying theology, but ended up studying   mathematics instead under Gauss’s tutelage at the 
University of Göttingen. Gauss once remarked that   Riemann had “a gloriously fertile originality”.
In his 1857 lecture, Riemann set out how to   extend Gauss’s work on differential geometry 
beyond three dimensions. Today this is known   as Riemannian geometry and, as we will see, 
it would prove a crucial breakthrough. 
  One of the most important concepts in Riemannian 
geometry is the geodesic - a line that represents   the shortest path between two points on a 
curved surface. This often leads to odd-looking   outcomes when you step down a dimension. 
Take the more than 30 flights that travel   between London and New York every day. London 
sits closer to the North Pole than New York,   so you’d think that a plane flying to the 
Big Apple would set off from the UK and   head south. In fact, it heads *north*, flies 
in a straight line, and still ends up further   south. This straight line across a 3D dimensional 
surface looks curved when drawn on a 2D map. 
  Perhaps even more bizarrely, it is possible 
to travel in a completely straight line from   Alaska to India without ever flying over land. 
When drawn on a 2D map this journey looks about   as far from straight as it is possible to 
get. However, look at that path from space   and you’ll clearly see how straight it is. 
And these ideas - geodesics and Riemannian   geometry would go on to form the backbone of 
Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity,   our best-tested explanation of gravity.
General Relativity says that the three   dimensions of space and the one dimension 
of time are irrevocably woven together into   a four dimensional fabric called spacetime 
- indeed it was Einstein's grumpy professor   Hermann Minkowski who actually coined the term. 
This means that Gaussian differential geometry,   which can only describe curvature in a total 
of three dimensions, is not sufficient. Only   Riemannian geometry, which generalises Gauss’s 
work to any number of dimensions, works.
  According to General Relativity, the presence of 
massive objects curves four dimensional spacetime   and it is this curvature that’s responsible 
for the apparent force of gravity. Earth,   for example, doesn't orbit the Sun because 
there's an invisible force of attraction   between them as Isaac Newton had suggested in 
the 17th century. Instead, the Sun distorts   the fabric of spacetime around it and the Earth 
is caught rolling around in this distortion.
  However, thinking of gravity in this 
way leads to what appears, at first,   to be a controversial statement: 
that the Earth orbits the Sun in a   straight line. At least that’s true in four 
dimensions. Just as the straight London to   New York flight path across a 3D surface 
appears curved when drawn on a 2D map,   the Earth’s straight path through 4D spacetime 
only appears curved in three dimensions. 
  This curvature is particularly apparent in 
an effect known as gravitational lensing.   When light from a distant source encounters a 
massive cluster of galaxies, the light’s path   appears to bend around it. Riemannian geometry 
allows astronomers to estimate the amount of   spacetime curvature required to do this, in turn 
leading to an estimate for the total mass of the   cluster. Usually there appears to be considerably 
more mass than can be accounted for by adding up   all the visible material in cluster, strongly 
hinting to astronomers that the difference is   made up of invisible ‘dark’ matter.
And so, this all means, that thanks   to its use of Riemannian geometry, General 
Relativity can completely describe spacetime,   our universe and its expansion in 
terms of intrinsic curvature alone.
  There is no need for an external embedding 
space and so no requirement for the universe   to be expanding into anything. 
However, as you might have guessed,   that is not quite the end.
For just because the universe   doesn’t need to be expanding into 
anything doesn’t mean that it isn’t…
  After seven long months travelling through the 
solar system, it is the next seven minutes that   will decide the fate of NASA’s Perseverance 
rover. Hurtling through the thin Martian   atmosphere at almost 20,000 kilometres per hour, 
from the planet's surface it looks like a giant   shooting star lighting up the daytime sky.
Suddenly, the parachute pops and flutters   open. The rover rig emerges from its protective 
chrysalis, stabilised in mid air by a series of   thrusters, finally dangling down from the 
sky crane on long, puppet-like wires. With   the rover safely deposited on the surface, the 
sky crane powers away so as not to contaminate   the pristine environment around Jezero crater 
that the mission has travelled almost half   a billion kilometres from Earth to explore.
Landing a car-sized rover on a distant planet   is no mean feat. Yet this mission has another, 
even more impressive achievement up its sleeve:   a miniature helicopter. Known as Ingenuity, it 
would go on to make the first powered flight on   another world. In fact, it would make a total of 
72 flights, despite only being designed for five.
  Endeavours like this are a stark reminder 
of just how weak the force of gravity really   is. Despite the heft of an entire planet, 
this tiny aircraft - with a fuselage the   size of a tissue box and weighing no more 
than a bag of potatoes - could climb over   twenty metres above the dusty Martian surface.
As well as this, of the four fundamental forces,   gravity also has the dubious honour of being 
the least understood - even though its rules   were discovered centuries before those of 
the other three. This is even more perplexing   considering that gravity is the force that 
most obviously affects our day-to-day lives. 
  To underscore the disparity between gravity 
and the forces, imagine two electrons. Their   gravitational attraction is one hundred 
tredecillion times weaker than the repulsive   electromagnetic force between them. That’s 
a one followed by a staggering 43 zeroes.
  This gulf in their might is particularly 
troublesome because physicists assume that   all four fundamental forces were once united into 
a single force immediately after the Big Bang,   before peeling away from each other in the 
universe’s first slivers of a second. 
  Indeed, there is already concrete evidence that 
the electromagnetic and weak forces were once the   electroweak force. And the rules that describe the 
strong force are so similar to those belonging to   the electroweak that they appear a perfect fit - 
we just haven’t ramped up the energy of particle   accelerators enough yet in order to find proof.
Gravity however, remains firmly out in the   cold. As we’ve seen, it is described by 
Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity   instead - a theory that doesn’t play 
nicely with the quantum field theories   we use to describe the other three forces.
And so if all four forces were once equal in   strength, what happened to relegate 
gravity to such a lowly footing?
  Well, the answer could lie in a 
sci-fi sounding branch of physics   known as the Braneworld - a truly bizarre 
theoretical example of an embedding space.
  According to these theories, our four 
dimensional spacetime is merely a surface - or   brane - embedded in a higher dimensional 
hyperspace known as “The Bulk”. The word   brane is a shortened form of “membrane”. 
Perhaps the easiest way to picture this is   to drop down a dimension. Imagine an ant crawling 
around the surface of a hollow sphere floating in   mid-air. That ant would be confined to 
a 2D surface – a brane – embedded in a   3D Bulk. Likewise, we could live on a 4D surface 
embedded in a Bulk with at least five dimensions.
  The Braneworld has its roots in string theory, 
which is one attempt to unite gravity with   its fellow forces. According to string theory, 
sub-atomic particles are made of tiny vibrating   strings, and within this theory just as you 
can play stringed instruments in different   ways to create different notes, so Nature plays 
these strings to create different particles.
  A family of particles called bosons is 
particularly important because they are   responsible for carrying forces. It is only 
by exchanging bosons that magnets can attract   or repel each other, for example. Atomic 
nuclei are only held together by the strong   force because bosons called gluons are being 
exchanged between their constituent parts.
  Physicists have already experimentally verified 
the bosons behind three of the four fundamental   forces, but they have yet to discover one linked 
to gravity. If it does exist, this “graviton” is   proving particularly hard to find. 
Despite its elusiveness, the graviton   could be the key to unlocking the mystery of why 
gravity appears so much weaker than the other   three fundamental forces, with implications 
for what the universe is expanding into.
  There are two types of string in string theory: 
open and closed. According to the Braneworld,   open strings must always remain tethered to 
a brane at one end. Closed strings, however,   which form a loop and so are effectively 
tethered to themselves, are free to wander   through the full extent of The Bulk. 
The graviton is thought to be made of   just such a closed string. In other words, the 
strength of gravity is diluted across both our   brane and The Bulk. The other three forces, with 
their open string bosons, are restricted to just   the brane. And so if true, it’s no wonder that we 
see gravity as considerably weaker than its fellow   forces. It is leaking away into hyperspace.
There are ways to test this idea with experiments,   even without the direct discovery of the 
graviton itself. It is possible that our   atom-smashing efforts at places such as the Large 
Hadron Collider could create gravitons through   the collision of ordinary particles. If some of 
these gravitons wander off into The Bulk, they   would leave behind tell-tale gaps in the data. 
Equally, physicists could find evidence of gravity   leaking into The Bulk in modern versions of a 
famous 18th century experiment by Henry Cavendish.   It was designed to measure the gravitational 
attraction between two nearby metal spheres.
  Forces usually follow what physicists refer 
to as an inverse square law. If you double   the distance between the two spheres, 
their gravitational attraction drops   to a quarter. Treble the distance and it drops 
to a ninth. The same holds for the strength of   the electromagnetic force between magnets. 
Now let's imagine that wandering gravitons   are causing gravity to leak away into a 
single extra dimension. In other words,   a 5 dimensional bulk. Gravity's potency 
should fall away more quickly and it will   follow an inverse cube law instead. That means 
doubling the distance between two masses would   see their attraction drop to an eighth instead 
of a quarter. In order to be consistent with   the apparent weakness of gravity that we observe, 
this divergence from the inverse square law would   show up over distances roughly equal to the 
gap between the Sun and the planet Uranus. 
  And so clearly astronomers would have noticed such 
a deviation by now. The orbits of the outer two   planets would follow different gravitational 
rules to those of the inner planets. 
  However, the more dimensions you add to 
The Bulk, the more avenues there are for   gravity to leak. This would lead to a greater 
deviation from the inverse square law as the   strength of gravity drops even faster. 
It would also reduce the distance over   which this deviation becomes apparent. 
For just two extra dimensions, it drops   dramatically from a literally astronomical 
distance to a mere 0.3 millimetres. That may   still sound relatively large, certainly compared 
to the size of atoms, but measuring gravity on   this scale is currently beyond our capabilities. 
However in 2021, a ground-breaking modern version   of the Cavendish experiment did measure the 
gravitational attraction between two 90 milligram   gold spheres separated by 40 millimetres. There 
was no deviation from the inverse square law.
  Perhaps one day we'll get this down to under 
0.3 millimetres and finally see the proof of   gravity leaking away into The Bulk. Although, 
even if physicists did spot a deviation,   it isn't smoking gun proof that our universe 
is a brane embedded in hyperspace. Instead   the extra dimensions that gravity is leaking 
into could be part of the universe itself,   curled up so small so as to remain out of sight.
Proving the existence of The Bulk would finally   us give a more concrete answer to the question 
of what the universe is expanding into. Our 4D   universe could be growing into a potentially 
infinite higher-dimensional hyperspace.
  But there is another potential way to 
use string theory in order to recreate   rules similar to those of quantum physics - 
a groundbreaking discovery that goes by the   rather dull name of AdS/CfT correspondence.
The AdS part is something we've encountered   before: anti-de Sitter space. The CfT stands 
for conformal field theory. The quantum rules   behind the Standard Model of Particle Physics, 
which exquisitely explain all of its sub-atomic   particles and the forces that govern them, are 
close cousins of conformal field theories.
  To better understand how AdS/CfT correspondence 
works, let's take a 3 dimensional example.
  First, imagine a disc that resembles an 
elaborate floor mosaic. It is made up   of triangles and squares that follow the 
usual rules of anti-de Sitter space. That   means the angles in the triangles add up 
to less than 180 degrees and squares have   angles that are pinched at the corners.
Next, stack multiple copies of this disc   on top of one another to form a cylindrical 
universe. This is an example of three dimensional   anti-de Sitter space. Measure the angles of a 
triangle anywhere within it and they will add   up to less than 180 degrees. But this cylinder 
has an unusual and critically important property.   Put yourself at any point on the boundary and the 
space immediately around you will follow the rules   of Minkowski space instead. In other words, the 
boundary of this anti-de Sitter space is flat. 
  Given that the universe around us also appears 
flat, could our cosmos be the boundary of a   higher dimensional anti-de Sitter bulk? That's 
the working idea behind AdS/CfT correspondence. 
  In theory, the bulk can have any number of 
dimensions and the boundary will always have   one fewer dimension. What's remarkable about 
AdS/CfT correspondence is that if you apply   string theory to a 5D anti-de Sitter bulk, 
the resulting physics on the 4D boundary are   exactly the same as the rules of quantum physics. 
That's the correspondence part – a twinning of the   physics of the bulk and the boundary. The two 
things are exactly equivalent of one another.
  Except there are big caveats to consider. In 
AdS/CfT correspondence, the four dimensions on the   boundary are all dimensions of space. We do seem 
to live in a four dimensional universe, but one of   those dimensions is time – only three are spatial 
dimensions. Plus, the conformal field theory that   appears on the boundary is a very close match 
to quantum physics, but not a perfect one. 
  So for now, AdS/CfT correspondence is not 
a complete description of our reality. 
  But when AdS/CfT correspondence was first proposed 
in the late 1990s by the Argentine physicist Juan   Maldacena, it was a shot in the arm for an older 
theory known as the holographic principle. 
  The hologram on the back of a credit card may 
give the illusion of looking three dimensional,   but in reality all the information is encoded on 
a 2D card. Likewise, with AdS/CfT correspondence,   all the information about the 5D bulk is encoded 
on the 4D boundary. In fact, AdS/CfT is sometimes   called Maldacena duality for this very reason.
It is also possible to take the same idea and   drop down a dimension or two. Our universe 
seems to have three spatial dimensions,   but could all the information about this 
universe actually be encoded on some distant 2D   boundary? Could the whole cosmos be a hologram?
It's certainly a tantalising prospect - one that   helps physicists solve other thorny issues 
such as what happens to information falling   into black hole. However, the holographic 
principle remains notoriously hard to test. 
  Yet it is a great illustration of the mental 
gymnastics and flights of fancy that physicists   are willing to endure in the search for answers 
to one of the universe's greatest of questions.   We've known for nearly a century that the universe 
is expanding. The work of Gauss and Riemannian led   us to Einstein, who told us that the universe 
doesn't need to be expanding into anything at   all. And yet, the idea of higher dimensions just 
won't go away. Should we ever find them, “What   is the universe expanding into?” certainly won't 
be the only monumental question being answered.

what is the biggest thing in the universe in 1985 cosmologists believed that they had found the answer a team led by John hucker at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for astrophysics had just completed a survey of thousands of galaxies in the direction of the constellation Koma barones but as they looked through the results they noticed something odd stretched across hundreds of millions of light years a shape began to slowly appear the shape of a person a stickman but the creature with a long slender torso outstretched arms and dancing legs was no monster of ancient legend it was one of our first glimpses of a super cluster and it was not alone our observable universe turned out to be full of superclusters roughly 10 million in total each one containing tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands of galaxies indeed our own Milky Way is nestled inside of one known as lanaka on one of its outer Limbs and these superclusters are massive at their smallest they are several hundred million light years long composed of lacing entwined branches and clumps of galaxies the largest stretch across the heavens for up to 10 billion light years and their enormous volume is matched only by their Mass a typical supercluster can hold over 10 million billion Suns worth of material the nearest superclusters are named simply for the constellation we have to peer through to map them the coma the Virgo the Hydra Centaurus the Pavo Indus more distant ones are usually given simple catalog designations unless they break some record in size or distance for example the king Gora supercluster one of the most massive yet mapped was discovered in 2022 by a team of Japanese scientists who named it after the three-headed Nemesis of Godzilla but despite the Monstrous size of these super clusters their

oppra it's free and you won't be disappointed thanks to oppra for supporting educational content on [Music] YouTube the year was 1978 and astronomers Le Thompson and Steven Gregory had set themselves in exhausting task staying up all night for nearly a week at the kit Peak Observatory located southeast of Tucson Arizona they were painstakingly recording the positions of dozens of galaxies after confirming the positions of these galaxies on the sky they then fed the light from their telescope into a simple tube that electronically Amplified it the Forerunner of the modern-day digital camera this technology allowed them to access exceptionally dim and distant galaxies far G than the reach they could normally get they were peering further into the universe than any astronomer had before once Amplified they then pass the light from the Galaxy into a spectrometer and from there Thompson and Gregory could measure the red shift of the galaxies using that to work out the distance there were no computers no sophisticated algorithms no utation Thompson and Gregory were performing a survey of galaxies by manually recording their positions and distances of course they were not the first to perform such a task astronomers had been carefully mapping Galaxy positions for decades but Thomson and Gregory had two tricks up their sleeves two techniques previously unapplied to cosmology one was their use of light amplification but their second trick wasn't one of technology or Theory or even deep Insight it was a plot a method of displaying the positions of their Newfound galaxies the plot looked like a slice of pizza putting the Earth at the pointy Apex and broadening outwards as the distances from the earth grew though the idea may not seem important it was revolutionary because it allowed Thompson and Gregory to place the large scales of the universe in context condensing the information into an easily digestable format the plan for their survey was to map the galaxies in and around the coma cluster known for decades as a dens gation of galaxies they hope to use their results to find differences between galaxies that were members of the cluster and those that were in the field the random scattering of galaxies thought to be strewn about the universe but instead they found something [Music] else a vast empty region devoid of any galaxies a patch millions of light years wide that should have been full of galaxies but wasn't a floor in the cosmos the new technique for plotting the positions of galaxies made it too obvious to ignore a dense collection of black dots represent the coma cluster a smattering of Dots here and there surrounding it and in the middle nothing and so they gave a name to this blank space a void when Thompson and Gregory published their work the astronomical Community was skeptical and sometimes outright hostile we've already taken the measure of the heavens they argued and galaxies inhabited the whole of the cosmos the pair of astronomers had clearly made a mistake perhaps they had some flaw in the design of their survey or maybe their eyes were simply deceiving them they wanted to see a void where there was none driven by their desire to make a dramatic Discovery no matter what nature ABS a vacuum and the void that they discovered should not and could not [Music] exist but that was in Europe and America for mere months after Thompson and Gregory released their results a trio of Estonian and Soviet astronomers and theorists published the results of their own survey in a different direction of the sky though their survey did not use the pizza shaped diagram they noted the existence of large holes in the distribution of galaxies and on top of this in contrast to the Western view of cosmology Soviet Le scientists had been deliberately looking for such structures in the west the dominant Paradigm of the large scale structure of the universe simply could not admit the existence of voids cosmological Theory held that the Universe was homogeneous meaning that it was on average roughly the same from place to place at large enough scales the particular pattern of galaxies might be different here and there but statistically everything was the same astronomers had known about the existence of clusters for some time but these were just denser than average lumps in an otherwise random distribution of galaxies for Americans and Europeans voids simply didn't fit but the Estonian and Soviet astronomers had a different view in the USSR the great theorist Yakov zeldovich had developed an entirely different proposal for the evolution of structure in the universe hypothesizing that large collections of material fracture and Splinter off over time forming ever smaller clumps like clusters and then galaxies in this picture voids naturally appear as a consequence of this continued fragmenting of the cosmos and so it wasn't until 1981 when American astronomer Robert kersner LED another survey in a completely different direction of the sky that the Western astronomical Community began to accept the reality of the V void kers and his colleagues found what is now known as the booti void which Still Remains as one of the largest known voids in existence the botti's void was larger than any Galaxy larger than any cluster larger than anything in the survey volume the botti's void was the largest single object in existence a vast expanse of emptiness dominating the heavens together with the coma void which the original void discovered by Thompson and Gregory came to be known as astronomers were forced to accept their existence but this raised big questions first of all very simply how the voids could exist and more importantly how could a homogeneous Universe permit such a blemish this was the birth of the study of the large scale structure of the universe and the discovery of the first voids ushered in our understanding of the true scope of our Cosmos the universe was not as cosmologists had previously suspected an endless series of galaxies occasionally clumped into clusters instead it was far more elegant the Clusters were there but they were only nodes dense kns caught in the tangle of long thin filaments of galaxies between them hung gigantic sheets walls of galaxies beyond the scale of human imagination and dwarfing them all were the voids the expanses of nothingness that at first defied but then defined the large scale structure of the universe but of course these voids demanded explanation what became increasingly clear in the 1980s and 1990s was that the Universe could still be homogeneous but only on truly enormous scales clusters did not represent the end of greatness even the smallest Cosmic voids utterly dwarfed them they defined and outlined a far vaster structure one that subsumed the entire observable universe and mapping that greater structure the voids and clusters together led to an even greater challenge finding explanation for its existence as cosmologists worked they would discover void after void and with each new generation of survey they would find vast expanses of emptiness to rival and even surpass the greatness of the bootes and coma voids and each time they found a new gigantic Cosmic void they would be forced to ask if this was truly the end would homogeneity a scale at which the universe was the same everywhere ever be found we do not know who made the lenux globe but we do know when it was constructed 1510 less than two decades after Columbus made contact between the old and new Worlds the globe features roughly accurate coastlines for Europe Africa and Asia although the proportions are grossly distorted by modern standards South America is present though only its Southern half North America is a series of large islands and there is no trace of Australia or Antarctica but along the eastern coast of Asia which at the time was known partly through secondhand accounts of sailors is written the Latin phrase ik dracones here be [Music] dragons the globe is one of only two known Maps to actually contain the phrase but the sentiment reached far and wide in medieval mapmaking at the time the world was just beginning to open up to Discovery trade and Conquest geographers were learning more and more about the structure of the world with every Voyage but for every measurement and Survey of a coastline or location of a city much remained unknown and so these early mapmakers faced a difficult decision what should they put in those blank spaces the answer was simple Fantastical illustrations of dragons serpents lions and other dangerous creatures to create a sense of wonder and mystery of the unknown lands of the world and to warn the viewer that Beyond the Lights of civilization lay hidden dangers but that sense of lurking danger of the unknown in the dark did not die with the map makers of the Age of Exploration as astronomers continue to pierce farther into the heavens they would also find empty places and boundaries of their knowledge our maps of the local universe begin with the known the named the safe our solar system a single star surrounded by eight planets and innumerable smaller objects is but one of hundreds of billions inhabiting our home the Milky Way this Galaxy with its serenely spiraling arms and dense Cor four spans 100,000 Li years in diameter though it's less than 30,000 Li years thick compared to that even the greatest possible extent of our solar system is at the same scale as a single microscopic cell compared to an entire human body sitting roughly 2 and a half million light years away from us is our nearest major neighbor Galaxy the Andromeda which contains up to a trillion individual Stars also gleaming brightly in a beautiful spiral pattern together with with triangulum and a scattering of other dwarf galaxies we form the local group it's a rather uncreative name but it's fitting it's a small group of galaxies bound together through their Mutual gravitational attraction whatever fate befalls the universe we will remain by each other's side the next nearest major cosmological object to us is a cluster specifically the Virgo named after the constellation you must look through to observe it clusters are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the cosmos they are dense cities homes to a thousand or more galaxies sometimes spanning millions of liers in diameter the Virgo cluster sits roughly 65 million light years away from us and it's at these scales that we truly enter into cosmological considerations the Virgo cluster sits as the centerpiece of what's known as a super cluster the largest glomeration of matter in the entire universe though they are not yet gravitationally bound meaning that the mutual self-gravity of all the galaxies within them have not completely pulled them together superclusters are still forming the name for our local super cluster is the Virgo supercluster which is an unfortunate bit of duplicated astronomy terminology the Virgo cluster Beats at the heart of the Virgo supercluster which is home to dozens of groups just like our local group group however more recently astronomers have discovered that the Virgo super cluster is just one branch of an even larger supercluster named lania taken from the Hawaiian word for immense Heaven the name is appropriate because lanaka contains four branches each large enough to count as a super cluster in their own right up to 500 individual groups and clusters and over 100 100,000 individual galaxies all forming a tangled branching reaching Mass stretching over half a billion light years the scale of lanaka compared to a single Galaxy is roughly the same as the scale of a City compared to a person but considering that each galaxy has tens if not hundreds of billions of individual Stars you can consider lanaka as a truly great Metropolis the equivalent of an immense City housing quadrillions of people its star count roughly equivalent to the number of ants that inhabit the Earth and lania is not alone beyond our home supercluster sit even more the Hercules supercluster the shapley supercluster the Perseus Pisces beyond that the sheer number of known superclusters outpaces our ability to give them individual names and so they are known simply as numerical ENT trees on a computer catalog recordings of their position in space and lists of their member galaxies taken together all the interconnected superclusters create the cosmic web the largest structure in the entire universe every corner of the observable Cosmos with a diameter of 95 billion light years is filled with this series of supercluster connected to supercluster a network of galaxies traversing the known universe where the Tangled branches meet massive clusters like Virgo appear with long thin filaments stretching between them and Broad walls sectioning off entire portions of the cosmos the size of the cosmic web is almost impossible to describe by analogy you could say that galaxies are compared to the cosmic web the same way that individual cells are compared to the human body but for this to truly work our cells would have to be a million times smaller than they are in reality the cosmic web is simply so vast so large that individual galaxies appear as nothing more than tiny dots of light each Galaxy home to hundreds of billions of individual Stars stretched across 100,000 light years but as dazzling and Inc comprehensibly vast as these superclusters are they are almost inconsequential to the Grand tapestry of our universe instead by volume the cosmos is almost entirely void all galaxies with the exception of the ones buried deep within the hearts of cluster live constantly on the edge never far from the vast Gulfs of relative nothingness that consume the universe and so in this sense the name Cosmic web is apt just as the threads of a spiders web also draw the eye but take up almost no space so too does the light of Galaxy after Galaxy Light Up The filaments and clusters and yet a dwarfed into nothingness by the nothing us between astronomers find it difficult to map the voids closest to us since they are so big and so empty that they require broad comprehensive surveys to reveal them but we do know that the nearest void to the Milky Way is the local void which by itself is nearly 200 million light years across beyond that we have the northern and southern voids the giant void and the bootes and coma voids Beyond them has cosm ological surveys continue to push deeper into the universe sit even more empty spaces arranged raggedly between and among the superclusters and yet despite their names each void is not perfectly empty they certainly that galaxies as the early astronomers found to their amazement but there are innumerable microscopic objects floating through the cosmos bits of hydrogen and helium cosmic rays and neutrinos blasting here and there and the ever present radiation from the cosmic microwave background but the density of matter within a void is definitely extremely low cosmologists typically Define a cosmic void as any region of the universe with a density lower than 20% of the cosmic average and considering that the cosmic average is roughly one hydrogen atom per cubic meter of space that's very low in contrast a Galaxy will have at minimum millions of times greater density than the cosmic average and so this means that deep within the hearts of voids aside from the occasional stray hydrogen atom or passing cosmic ray you can find yourself millions of light years away from any significant structure Galaxy or even star they are by far the lonliest places in the universe indeed these voids aren't just empty of matter they are also so empty of Dark Matter Dark Matter makes up over 80% of the mass of almost every single Galaxy and cluster in the cosmos even though it is completely invisible and made of some particle unknown to Modern physics and this dominance of Dark Matter extends to the filaments and walls of the cosmic web itself what we see in the galaxies are just the bright lighthouses on a distant dark Shore giving us faint glimpses into the true structures beneath and so the cosmic web is made of dark matter and in turn the cosmic voids are empty of Dark Matter although we cannot directly observe the distribution of dark matter in observations because we're limited to observing light emitting galaxies we can see the full glory of the Dark Matter Cosmic web in cosmological simulations the densest concentration of Dark Matter correspond to the appearance of clusters while threads of Dark Matter contain filaments of galaxies and where there's no Dark Matter deep in the greatest of cosmic voids there are also no galaxies Galaxy surveys like the Sloan digital Sky survey have discovered tens of thousands of voids in the universe and even that represents only a tiny fraction of the observable Cosmos the smallest voids are roughly 20 million light years in diameter and astronomers find them embedded inside of much larger accumulations of matter relatively tiny empty Pockets buried within superclusters whereas the largest voids stretch across significant fractions of the known universe separating their boundary superclusters by a billion light years and more and it's in these enormous voids that we find the beginning of a potential problem the voids are big and empty which was a surprise to early astronomers but we do now have an understanding of how they along with the brightly lit superclusters formed over the course of billions of years of cosmic history but some observations suggest that the very largest voids may be a little too large that they break our understanding of cosmology that they shouldn't belong in the universe these are the so-call super voids the entrance was in the bottom corner of a sinkhole completely covered from above stumbled upon

even has its own ecosystem and weather and it spent millions of years hiding in plain sight undisturbed our world is full of hidden wonders empty spaces lingering undiscovered right beneath our feet and above our heads so what else are we missing in the universe what caves what empty spaces lurk in the vast reaches of the cosmos and what do these Cosmic caves teach us the voids and super voids are there between and among the great structures of the universe and we've only just begun to explore their terrible [Music] depths but despite their enormous Universe dominating size these voids have not always been this large just like their counterparts the walls filaments and clusters the voids began their lives as subatomic fluctuations in the quantum foam that permeates all of space and time these fluctuations were briefly Frozen in place during the tumultuous Epoch of inflation that hypothesized event which cosmologists suspect occurred well before our universe was even once second old increased the size of the cosmos by multiple orders of magnitude in the process subatomic variations in SpaceTime enlarged drastically to become very small variations in SpaceTime but what came after is all due to gravity these tiny pockets of curved SpaceTime had slightly stronger gravitational attraction which allowed matter to begin pooling in them as matter piled together those clumps had an even stronger gravitational pull which in turn increase their ability to pull in even more matter from their surroundings like a cave that starts as a small stream of water carving a space for itself in the crust over the next hundreds of millions of years the slow but persistent machinations of the gravitational force would begin the process of building the cosmic web the first Stars Gathering to a light the first galaxies the first galaxies assembling into the first groups the beginnings of the Wisp thin tendrils of the filaments connected ing them sending more material funneling into the initial massive clusters but in our universe when the rich get richer the poor get poorer as matter continued to accumulate onto the galaxies and groups and clusters it had to come from somewhere and it came from the [Music] voids starting their lives as one part per million depressions in density scarcely noticeable from any other patch of the universe the voids emptied out and enlarged compared to the massive structures which built themselves up from violent collisions and Furious mergers the early voids LED quiet Placid lives they simply got bigger matter pulled out of them and into their surroundings at first slowly then at a quicker Pace as the gravitational attraction of the cosmic web grew larger over the same hundreds of millions of years that saw the emergence of the first stars and galaxies the first voids also appeared in tandem beginning as Tiny forgotten pockets and steadily increasing their volume until they quickly dominated the cosmic web voids occasionally merge just as galaxies and clusters do but when voids come together it is a much less violent Affair if a wall of Galaxy separates two voids voids for example then over time the galaxies in matter in that wall slowly disperse making their way to the dense clusters on the perimeter of the wall when enough material leaves the wall the two voids become a single larger entity no Titanic Collision no great release of energy just the inexorable expansion of nothing this kind of flexibility made it difficult for cosmologists to precisely Define a void but recently they have come up with a unique Solution One inspired by a completely different field of study geography geographers often want to identify the sources and flows of water on a land mass discovering the path of water AIDS in understanding ecosystems mapping and mitigating the effects of pollution and measuring the availability of groundwater for drinking irrigation and industry to do this geographers create a map known as a watershed a watershed is a region where all the water flows to the same destination watersheds are typically divided by high topographical features like mountains and ridges if you imagine pouring rain water over the continental United States for example you'll find some water flowing towards the Pacific and some water flowing towards the Atlantic the Rocky Mountains serve as the ridg line between these two different wall Watershed regions and so if we imagine the high density regions of the universe like walls and filaments as high peak Mountains and the low density voids as The Valleys between them we can perform a similar kind of analysis if we imagine pouring water throughout the Universe allowing that water to run from the heights of the filaments and walls and Into The Valleys of the voids this Watershed technique provides cosmologists with a clear cohesive definition of a oid they are simply the low density regions of the universe defined by the surrounding topology just as the watersheds on a land mass are defined by the mountain peaks and ridges that surround them and determine where water flows using this technique cosmologists have been able to leverage existing Galaxy surveys like the Sloan digital Sky survey and the dark energy survey to map and catalog tens of thousands of individual voids in the nearby universe and in those surveys cosmologists have begun to identify a hierarchy of voids the largest voids in the universe are not completely empty instead they contain small collections of dim red galaxies and those galaxies are not scattered about randomly inside the voids deeper analysis has revealed that those galaxies as feeble as they are arrang themselves into a cosmic web in miniature with small groups and thin tenuous filaments and sitting between those tenuous filaments a voids unto themselves nestled within the volume of the greater voids imagine a gigantic cave system with a main chamber leading to smaller empty spaces divided by thin walls of rock that is what cosmologists are finding in the cosmic web and Analysis of voids in simulations of the cosmic web reveal EV even deeper levels with subub voids nestled inside of sub voids nestled inside of voids indeed the structure of voids in the universe is fractal like in nature with the same Cosmic web structure appearing again and again from smaller to larger scales however we cannot directly observe all the levels of this nested hierarchy because the cosmic web mostly exists in dark matter with only a portion of it illuminated with galaxies but where does that fr cile like hierarchy stop are the largest known voids like the bootes void the largest possible voids in existence or are they mere sub voids of even larger expanses of emptiness the super voids one hint at the existence of super voids comes from an unexpected Source the cosmic microwave background or CMB the CMB is the leftover light generated when our universe was only 380,000 years old at that time the universe was a million times smaller than it is today and had an average temperature of around 10,000 Kelvin forcing all the matter in the cosmos into a state of a high density high temperature plasma as the universe expanded from that state the plasma cooled becoming a neutral gas and the first atoms appeared this process also made the universe transparent to radiation and that radiation flooded the young Cosmos persisting to the present day as a bath of low energy microwave radiation the CMB isn't perfectly smooth as it contains one part in a million variations in temperature cooler and hotter spots of various sizes cosmologists understand the statistics of these spots both their size and their temperature and use them to glean an enormous amount of information about the state of the young universe except one known simply as the cold spot a particular region of the CMB is both exceptionally large and exceptionally cold in fact it's so large and so cold that standard cosmological models could not account for it it is an anomaly there is to date no widely accepted explanation for this cold spot and theories have ranged from radical changes to our cosmological models to the tantalizing possibility that the cold spot is the intersection point of our universe with another but the most likely explanation is that when we look at the cold spot we're really just looking at a vast shallow combination of voids a super void the super void can affect our view of the CMB because of the fact it has not always been here it took time for the supervoid to evolve out of the primordial Cosmic web when light from the CMB first entered the supervoid long ago it was relatively small and shallow but the super void is so big that it took hundreds of millions even billions of years to make the crossing in that time the Super void widened and deepened and so when the light finally made its way out of the other end it found found itself having to overcome a much deeper gravitational well than when it entered this sapped energy from the cmbb light resulting in a cold spot in that direction and the cold spot super void also known as the aridus super void is not alone another Super void the cares vatz super void also known simply as the giant void sits over 1 and A2 billion light years away but stretches across a vast 1.3 billion Li years diameter but largest of all in 2013 a trio of researchers Ryan Keenan Amy Barger and Lennox cowi proposed the existence of a truly enormous supervoid this void known occasionally as the KBC void after its discoverers or the great pole would be the largest void ever known potentially up to 3 billion light years in diamet on top of this despite all the large structures surrounding the Milky Way galaxy like the lanaka and shapley superclusters this supervoid would contain them all with its volumes so large that it could contain all these structures and still have an average density low enough to be called a void the trio of astronomers proposed the existence of this super void to help explain discrepancies in the measurement of the Hubble constant which is the present-- day expansion rate of the universe measurements taken from the early Universe like the CMB differ from measurements taken in the modern Universe like with Supernova since the Interiors of voids and super voids have different rates of expansion the KBC void with its enormous volume surrounding us could explain the difference however the existence of the KBC void remains highly disputed as astronomers have not found additional independent evidence for its existence regardless of the existence of the disputed KBC void the other known super voids stretch if not outright break our understanding of cosmology like a cave that could never have formed in geologic time scales given our knowledge of cave formation processes the problem is that voids May simply be too big we understand the scale where the universe becomes homogeneous as a product of gravity and time we know what the early Universe was like because we have highly detailed maps of the size of matter fluctuations thanks to our observations of the CMB from there we can take our understanding of how gravity works and the fundamental components of the universe to trace out the ensuing evolution of the cosmic web and the results of those calculations tell us that if we zoom out to scales of 300 million light years the universe should be roughly the same from place to place in other words one 300 million Lightyear patch of the universe should be the same at least in a statistical sense as any other 300 million Lightyear patch to get a better sense of what homogeneity means in this context imagine taking a square patch of land and measuring how many people live within that patch obviously people are not spread homogeneously across the Earth there are far more people crowded into dense cities far fewer in the rural outskirts and almost nobody in deserts if your patch is too small say 100 km across then your patches will be very different some will capture nothing but inhospitable desert or mountain ranges While others may be centered on bustling cities but if you make your patch big enough then every patch will at least get some cities many rural areas and Broad areas of uninhabited regions that is the homogene scale where every patch has roughly the same average population and so the presence of the largest voids potentially threatens our understanding of cosmology because they are like vast deserts that stretch farther than even our biggest plausible patch the largest super voids are larger than a purported scale where the universe should become homogeneous and so the question becomes are these super voids just randomly large through sheer Cosmic accident and don't otherwise affect our understanding of homogeneity or are they so big that we need to revise our understanding of how large structures appear and grow in the cosmos if a cave on the earth is too big and too deep it starts to threaten our understanding of [Music] geology there is no firm answer within the the cosmological community to this question some cosmologists argue that the known super voids are far too large and violate our current understanding of homogeneity and therefore Force us to reconsider our cosmological models perhaps a new fifth force of nature or some new element in the cosmos explains how the super voids have grown so massive but at the same time other cosmologists argue that we should expect the occasional supervoid Even in our nearby patch of the universe based on results from extremely complex computer simulations of the growth of structure while there remains no resolution to this debate one thing is clear the voids have not stopped growing they emerged billions of years ago as Tiny pockets of low density embedded in a sea of matter they have grown to their present scale where they dominate the volume of the universe and over the next few billion years they will come to rip apart the cosmic web and leave nothing but Darkness [Music] behind there are many dangers lurking in the cosmos many processes whose sole desire is to grow expand and and consume simple diseases like viruses and bacteria are limited in their growth by the resources available in the biosphere and competition with other organisms but on the very largest scales there is nothing that can stand in the way of all consuming multiplication the cosmic voids are more than mere empty holes in the distribution of matter in the universe they were once much smaller than they are today they're not done growing and in a strange trick of physics they there is nothing that can ever stop them we live in an expanding Universe with every passing day our Cosmos grows larger and larger another way to State this is to say that the average distance between galaxies grows with time there may be occasional mergers here and there for example the Milky Way galaxy will merge with Andromeda in roughly 5 billion years but at large enough scales this expansion becomes apparent and in the late 1990s astronomers discovered that this expansion is accelerating the expansion of the universe is getting faster and faster every day even to this day nobody knows for sure what's causing this accelerated expansion but it does have an appropriately mysterious name dark energy in the simplest and most straightforward models of what Dark Energy could be physicists treat it as a fundamental aspect of the vacuum of SpaceTime it's itself this means that if you were to take a box and empty out all the particles and the radiation leaving behind a perfectly empty volume you would still have a box filled with dark energy this dark energy has an extremely weak repulsive gravitational effect which means we can't notice the effects of it where there are large concentrations of mass like galaxies and clusters but averaged across the entire universe it becomes dominant causing the universe's expansion to accelerate and this means that there is only one place in the universe where Dark Energy dominates the cosmic voids the Deep depths of vast emptiness that Define the nature of these voids means that they are not truly empty they are indeed void of matter and radiation but they are filled to the brim with dark energy a disease that is infecting the universe it is within the voids not the galaxies not the filaments not the Clusters where the expansion of the universe is accelerating and the cosmic voids aren't just blandly expanding as matter accumulates around their edges because of dark energy they are literally pushing on their borders driving more and more matter away from their centers they are pressing on the walls between them thinning them out they are squeezing on the filaments breaking them apart and this when will not stop in fact it will get worse as the universe expands and the voids grow larger there will be even more dark energy in the universe allowing dark energy to become more powerful Dark Energy first began to dominate the evolution of the universe about 5 billion years ago it was in that era that the ground story of structure formation in the cosmos from The Humble seeds planted in the first chaotic moments of inflation to the spinning of the grandest structures in the universe began to come to an end a subtle symptom that something was deeply sick in the cosmos this means that the great superclusters that stretch and wind and twist for hundreds of millions of light years will never truly come together the voids surrounding them will crush them to death breaking the tenuous bonds between the Clusters and driving all matter as far away from itself as it possibly can in only a few billion years the cosmic web will be destroyed consumed by the ever growing voids within it no more filaments no more superclusters no more walls only isolated groups and clusters separated by an ever increasing vast expanse of absolute nothingness of voidness the far distant future of the universe belongs to the void they will win they will leave nothing behind as they ravage the universe but in an ironic twist voids are Humanity's most crystal clear windows into the deepest layers of the past when cosmologists try to understand the Universe they only have two choices one choice is to search for Direct observational evidence from specific epochs like the cosmic micro background but the CMB is fundamentally limited it was a singular event that happened only once briefly in the entire history of the cosmos and so it only carries so much information with it whereas the other choice cosmologists have is to observe as much of the modern day universe as possible building maps of the distribution of galaxies groups clusters and voids and use those Maps combined with our knowledge of physics to rewind the clock and try to learn what the universe is made of the contents of the universe the amount of normal matter dark matter and dark energy determine how the cosmic web evolves a universe with much larger strengths of dark energy for example would have never formed a cosmic web in the first place while a universe with too little dark matter would have only formed weak and feeble galaxies the story of the entire history of the universe is written in the cosmic web a vast Treasure Trove of data that can tell us what the universe is made of how it evolved over billions of years and what its ultimate fate will be but the cosmic web is enormously complex in principle we can rewind the evolution of every cluster and every Galaxy back to the primordial soup of hydrogen and helium bil of years ago after all it's just a bunch of particles interacting with each other through the fundamental laws of physics but in practice this is nearly impossible for example your body contains trillions upon trillions of hydrogen atoms these hydrogen atoms have inhabited the cosmos for over 13 billion years the properties of those same hydrogen atoms their positions their velocities the particular combinations and Arrangements inside your body contain some faint memory of the universe as it was all those billions of years ago but discovering those early conditions by examining your body would entail figuring out every single interaction that those hydrogen atoms participated in during all those billions of years so even though there is an echo of the early Universe still inhabiting your body finding it is nearly impossible and the same holds true of entire galaxies and clusters they are so complex so busy with star form magnetic fields cosmic rays supern noi and all manner of intricate physics that we can't ever hope to disentangle the primordial conditions of the universe by observing them but the voids are simple the voids are empty the voids are clean the voids are boring they have barely changed in billions of years of Cosmic history though they have grown bigger and occasionally merged with their neighbors all those processes are slow careful deliberate the voids are therefore relatively unevolved when it comes to Great Cosmic objects they provide the perfect window into the early Universe if you want to know what the cosmos was like billions of years ago you can look into the voids and because the voids are filled with dark energy they also hold deep within them the Ultimate answers to that vexing mystery even though dark energy is thought to suffuse every cubic cimer of SpaceTime it's impossible to Define its nature inside of dense regions like solar systems galaxies and clusters there's simply too much other stuff and all the associated complex dynamics that go along with that stuff to figure out how dark energy works but not in the voids voids are brimming with dark energy they are Laboratories where cosmologists can go to study the deepest workings of the dark side of the [Music] cosmos and so for decades Cosmic voids have languished in the shadows a forgotten and ignored byproduct of traditional surveys of the bright objects of the universe their initial Discovery was even ridiculed and mocked as cosmologists didn't believe that the Universe could possibly create such vast regions of absolutely nothing but in the past decade interesting Cosmic voids has exploded thanks to new techniques like the Watershed to reliably find them within surveys of galaxies and now that those surveys are broad enough cosmologists have more than just a meager handful of voids to study they have thousands to catalog the European Space agency's uclid Telescope launched in 2023 will conduct a massive survey mapping the positions of millions of galaxies where the study of voids was once on the fringes of cosmology the uid research team now includes a group devoted to finding Cosmic voids within the survey and using them to understand dark matter and dark energy the same is true for NASA's next Flagship Mission the Nancy Grace Roman telescope which also has a working group devoted to their study and so with every passing year the universe appears to be teaching us something important about the nature of voids if we want to understand the deepest Mysteries of the cosmos test the limits of our theories and find clever ways to push past them into a new understanding of physics we must learn how to stare into the deep Abyss [Music] you've been watching the entire history of the universe don't forget to like And subscribe and leave us a comment to tell us what you think thanks for

continent on Earth but where is Earth whites in the solar system between Venus and Mars you might say where is that the solar system is the main part of the art cloud a vast collection of comets asteroids and icy objects swirling at the fringes of the sun's sphere of influence the Oort cloud resides in the local Interstellar Cloud which is in the local cavity of the Orion arm of the Milky Way galaxy The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy with beautiful sweeping arms of millions upon millions of stars all rotating around a bright Galactic core with a dark supermassive black hole at its Center at over a hundred thousand light years across the Milky Way is vast but it is still just a sliver of what we can see zoom out further and you will see a local group with 30 to 50 small galaxies and a monster on a collision course the Andromeda galaxy twice the size of the Milky Way Andromeda is speeding towards us we will collide in a few billion years tearing each other apart before coalescing into one but when you zoom out even further the impending Collision of two galaxies seems inconsequential at the scale of millions of light years the structure of the Virgo supercluster a collection of thousands of galaxies becomes apparent and dwarfing even that is the Lanier chaos supercluster hundreds of millions of light years across containing several other superclusters like our Virgo and which is itself part of the Pisces cetus supercluster complex a galactic filament almost a billion light years long and it is now that the cosmic web becomes visible there are more filaments like our own as well as great strings of superclusters there are also giant stretches of space with virtually nothing in them like the booties void an area 330 million light years across in which we have discovered barely 60 galaxies an inkblot on the speckled sky zooming out further we finally reach the edge of the observable universe where primordial light has been traveling since nearly the beginning of time 13.8 billion years to reach our eyes but since then of course the universe has expanded further meaning that the true distance to the edge is about 46 billion light years in One Direction meaning the full observable universe is a sphere 93 billion light years in diameter [Music] structures any larger than a few billion light years are hard to Define without current technology partially because we are trying to map something we inhabit and partially because there may well be a limit something scientists call the end of greatness but at every level up to this point planets solar systems galaxies clusters superclusters universe is full of structure it is not a random and chaotic jumble it seems organized yet the universe started as a hot dense soup of particles why should it now be structured why did that hot soup evolve into a universe where some parts are filled with beautiful sweeping arms of stars While others are Barren deserts and more importantly how do we know how did we start this channel to begin with a lot of research and in-depth exploration of the universe's first moments and a huge part of that was done through wondriam the educational

education I did by heading over to wandrium.com forward slash history of the universe thanks to wandrium for education on YouTube the year is 1502 and Nicolaus Copernicus should be studying medicine in Padua it is the Center for Medical Education in Europe all the best teachers and students gather there to learn how to heal the sick but Nicolaus is a polymath he is learning medicine but he's also reading Aristotle and Plutarch and Plato and finding holes in ptolemy's theories in his spare time finishing his degree he returns home to Poland to work as a physician for his father though he doesn't forget about the cosmos or our place in it and so it is a decade later that he writes a pamphlet outlining his now ubiquitous Theory we are not the center of the universe the Earth orbits the sun just like all the other planets we are not special niklaus knows the Uproar this will cause so he doesn't publish right away it is only in his 70th year some say it's actually on deathbed that he proves the final copy that the book finally comes out a shakes the very foundations of science astronomy philosophy and religion an idea so dangerous and Fantastical that its proponents would be persecuted for decades after its publication the heretical notion that our Earth is just the third planet among many at the time it was a shocking thought but it marked only the beginning of a larger Revelation for if we are just some Planet orbiting a random star what does that make us not special it's a sad realization at first but when we think deeper it opens up a world of possibilities if we are not special what else is out there who else is out there to discover known as the copernican principle the idea is now a Bedrock of modern cosmology and has two related tenets the Earth is not special we don't occupy some privileged position in the universe therefore observations from the earth should be relatively representative of observations from anywhere one modern day discovery that backed up this claim was the detection of the cosmic microwave background or the CMB a fuzzy background static it permeates the sky no matter in which direction you look no matter how powerful your telescope if you keep zooming in on a part of the sky with nothing in it you will still detect faint microwave radiation always with almost the same wavelength emitted at a time close to the beginning of the universe at the moment when Mata cooled down enough for protons to capture electrons and become clear gas it is everywhere in this regard our bit of the universe is clearly not special outer space no matter which direction you look has a temperature of about 2.7 degrees Kelvin it doesn't matter if you are floating in outer space near the Milky Way or past distant Methuselah the average temperature of empty space is about the same but there is an obvious issue with this and one that doesn't require a high-powered telescope to recognize our Cosmic address is full of huge structures galaxies super clusters Great Walls of stars hundreds of millions of light years across and great voids with nothing in them the universe clearly isn't totally uniform we aren't special but there are structures all large-scale structure in the universe can be explained by two opposing forces expansion and gravity the universe started hot and dense and then underwent three phases of expansion the first lasted a fraction of a second and was extreme this is called inflation it then continued to expand in a second stage for several billion years at a more reasonable rate cooling down spreading out and slowing its expansion and in the last few billion years it has entered the third stage in which expansion has accelerated again and so what is responsible for these shifting regimes of expansion the initial inflation has been theorized to have been caused by a mysterious field called the inflaton the latter expansion a mysterious energy so baffling it's simply known as dark energy in truth we don't know for sure but what we are sure of is the existence of gravity which has spent billions of years battling against the quickening expansion when a part of the early Universe became a bit denser that over density attracted more matter which consequently made it more massive and so gravity acted even stronger to bring more matter in clouds of dust and gas became Stars which clumped into galaxies and so on it was and is gravity doing what gravity does at its most basic level problem solved but not quite can't start this process with a totally even universe just where did the first over densities come from [Music] the best dancers we have now started to be revealed with space telescopes in the late 1980s and the race to map the entire universe to higher and higher resolution the cosmic background Explorer Kobe was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Southern California by NASA in 1989. the Cold War was ending and a new era of cooperation between Global superpowers was about to begin and what better way to start this New Era than the first baby picture of the universe Kobe had a bold Mission take detailed images of the entire celestial sphere and tell us how uniform the background radiation really is and so on April the 24th 1992 the results were plastered on the front page of the New York Times scientists report profound Insight on how time began Kobe had mapped tiny variations anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation they were very small just one part in a hundred thousand but they were there this Blockbuster result won two Nobel prizes in 2006 for two of the lead astronomers on the telescope John C Matha and George F Smoot with the Nobel committee marking it as the birth of cosmology as a precise science success of Kobe LED NASA to launch another telescope in 2001 called the Wilkinson microwave and isotropy probe or w-map this further proved the Blockbuster capabilities of space telescopes and instead of a vague smear of under and overdense regions wmap was able to tell fine structure and patterns started to emerge so again in 2009 the Planck satellite was launched by the European Space Agency to get an even better picture of the baby Universe each successive experiment kept demonstrating the same principle there were tiny fluctuations in the very early Universe which after being stretched out by expansion and clumped by gravity led to the structures we see today and there are dozens of other experiments telescopes and satellites each discovering and mapping new parts of this structure back on Earth one of the best telescopes for mapping the universe is the Sloan digital Sky survey perched on a mountain in New Mexico this telescope creates a map of the whole sky in an unusual way first the astronomers take a regular Optical image then they create an aluminum plate with a precise hole drilled for each star or other astronomical object in the image they then run a fiber optic cable from each of the holes in the plate to spectrographs so they can find the colors of the stars and therefore find out how far away they are and how fast they're moving these rainbow collecting aluminum plates are each custom drilled and capture a unique slice of the universe so far over ten thousand plates have been drilled by combining data from different surveys astronomers managed to Define Lanier Kea our local supercluster home a group of thousands of galaxies all bound together by gravity and our universe maps are filled with many more Fantastical places of course stretching out from our own local group of galaxies is the Virgo supercluster whose tendrils Connect into The Centaurus supercluster beyond that is the Perseus Pisces supercluster and the South Pole wall which stretches across over a billion light years and the Sloan Great Wall is about 1 billion light years in the other direction an equally Mammoth structure and some astronomers believe that the Milky Way and a large part of Lani Ikea actually reside within another supermassive void known as KBC proposed to be almost 2 billion light years in diameter though its existence is still hotly debated and even these have been dwarfed by a recent discovery the giant Ark was discovered in 2021 and is about 9 billion light years away it is thought to span 3.1 billion light years three and a half percent of the observable Cosmos and is so huge it actually challenges our assumptions about the Universe on the largest scales if you zoom all the way out a pattern appears filaments tie together into walls and clusters with large voids hanging between them but what is the structure of this web is it like meatballs of matter in a soup of emptiness or pancakes of matter arranged at jaunty angles surprisingly answering this seemingly ridiculous question which kitchen metaphor does the large-scale structure of our universe most resemble would obsess the field of cosmology for decades truth pride and Nobel prizes were at stake at the largest scales is the universe like a meatball soup a honeycomb or a sponge foreign veteran of the Soviet Atomic program sits in his office in Moscow contemplating the universe how did the large-scale structure of the universe arise he asks himself perhaps his contemplations make him hungry for lunch on the other side of the world a mild-mannered Canadian sits in his office in Princeton contemplating the universe how do tiny particles become huge galaxies similarly hunger-inducing thoughts so perhaps he wanders down to the cafeteria for a break the name of the astronomer in America is Jim Peebles he would eventually win the Nobel Prize in physics in 2019 for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology he and others of the American School believe that matter in the universe was organized like meatballs in a low-density soup Mata would attract Mata which would attract more mass clumping together in roughly spherical assemblies leaving vast areas of low density this was a bottom-up approach the large-scale structure gets formed by clumping smaller scale structures meanwhile behind the Iron Curtain Soviet astronomers were busy developing their own Theory Yakov zeldevich was the Russian musing on the cosmos by the 1970s he was a renowned physicist who had cut his teeth in the Soviet nuclear program before turning his attention to the large-scale structure of the universe he had developed a theory where the density in the universe was organized in 2D pancakes and where the pancakes overlapped you would have Galaxy formation in this way the large-scale structure comes first and galaxies are formed from them in zeldovich's Universe there are large empty voids with filaments on the edges of Pancakes and clusters where pancakes intersect zeldevich was a brilliant scientist with a lot of sway in the Soviet Union but because of his role he was rarely if ever permitted to leave the USSR his ideas therefore took longer to disseminate than they might have otherwise and so at the height of the Cold War you had Jim Peebles a soft-spoken Canadian Living in the USA advocating for a universe dominated by meatball clumps and the Russian School led by a hardened veteran of the Soviet Atomic program believing in the pancake model meatballs versus pancakes there's no evidence of animosity between the two but without hard data each stuck to their own beliefs but luckily between them was an unlikely interloper Martin Reese an English astronomer Who Would One Day become the UK's astronomer Royal he acted as a sort of go-between for the American and Russian schools the English were more permissive about which meetings they were allowed to attend than either the Americans or the Russians and so Reese's post-doc a man from Kentucky named Richard Gott then developed a third theory that better matches the findings of later experiments like the Sloan digital Sky survey got met zeldovich at a conference in Estonia then part of the USSR in 1977 and this meeting along with developments in observation would lead to a new understanding of the universe as recounted by God in his book The Cosmic web zeldovich was a character always use the median he said in Russia the watches are not made very well so when friends get together they compare the times on their watches one says 5 minutes to five another says five o'clock the other says 11 o'clock use the median inspired by the brilliant Soviet got would develop a new Theory the universe is like a sponge the topology of God's Universe lies conceptually between the American meatballs and the Russian pancakes according to him high density and low density regions are connected and complementary in other words you could switch high density for low density and it would be the same [Music] as new maps like those from the Sloan digital Sky survey became available this is the structure that was observed neither meatballs nor pancakes but a sponge but this is not everything that our telescopes have seen as our methods of scanning the skies have improved and we have seen further and further back in time with increasing detail something strange has been observed a phenomena referred to by some as the end of greatness at around a billion light years the universe finally becomes homogeneous the same everywhere large-scale structure disappears why [Music] imagine you are in Ecuador standing on the equator look up in the night sky with a powerful telescope and observe the cosmic microwave background radiation in all of its Majesty take a careful measurement of its temperature now fly to Indonesia on the equator on the exact opposite side of the Earth and look up if you take a careful measurement of the temperature of the CMB you'll find it matches the measurement you took in Ecuador the light from each point took about 14 billion years to reach you meaning the points would now be 28 billion light years apart except that space has been expanding in the intervening years so they're really much farther away than that and yet the universe is only about 13.8 billion years old to put it simply there hadn't been enough time for the light that you saw in Indonesia to have reached the light you saw in Ecuador so how could they possibly be the same temperature how could they know what temperature to agree on if they couldn't thermodynamically talk to each other perhaps it's a coincidence so you pick two other random points in the sky they will also match temperature to within one part in a hundred thousand this is the Horizon problem when you look at the microwave background radiation it is extremely uniform when you look at colorful images from experiments like wmap or Planck the color differences are deceptive the differences between red and blue are actually tiny they are differences of one part in a hundred thousand for almost all intents and purposes that's the same temperature and so this poses a fundamental physical challenge and it is one of the reasons for the development of the idea of inflation the theory proposed by Alan Guth in the 1980s is that there must have been some very rapid expansion in the early Universe with inflation parts of the universe that are now separated by unimaginable distances could have been in very close proximity in the past but in order for inflation to solve the Horizon problem the expansion would have to have taken place much faster than the speed of light this may seem counter-intuitive because of the universal speed limit of light but that only applies to matter and energy within the universe space itself doesn't need to obey this speed limit in fact due to the rate of expansion of the universe space today is still expanding faster than the speed of light two galaxies more than 15 to 20 billion light years apart would be moving away from each other faster than light this means that the part of the universe you saw in Indonesia and the part you saw in Ecuador used to be much closer together so close in fact that they could equilibrate and calls the haze of uniformity that we see when we look out but of course inflation is an extraordinary claim for which extraordinary evidence is required and definitive observational proof for this Theory remains elusive despite this indirect proof continues to pile up which makes inflation an attractive Theory as we know a universe that underwent inflation would be homogeneous which on large scales ours is an inflationary Universe would also be flat which ours appears to be this flatness refers not to the number of Dimensions but instead to the effect of the density of matter and energy in the universe cosmologists can measure the shape of the universe in two independent ways first they can count up all the mass and energy in the universe and divide it by the critical energy density the density at which the universe would be flat and they can also measure it geometrically by measuring angles on a positively curved sphere like the earth a try angle drawn on the surface will have angles that add up to more than 180 degrees the 3D geometry of the universe would be closed like this if it had more stuff in it eventually gravity would pull everything together into a big crunch in a universe with less stuff in it expansion would continue forever and space would be hyperbolic in a flat universe straight lines and angles make sense triangles have angles that add up to 180 degrees results from both types of experiment show that what we have is a flat universe another plus point for inflation and so this is strong evidence for the theory but how then did inflation work to make the universe we see one of almost perfect homogeneity but not exactly perfect much of course can be gleaned from the universe's baby picture the CMB which shows us the after effects of very early fluctuations in density in the early universe but anything before the CMB is obscured by the fact that everything was too hot for light to travel in straight lines excited electrons kept getting in the way and inflation is supposed to have happened within a tiny fraction of a second after the birth of the universe and so there are nearly 380 000 years of physics that are hidden by the haze of Three Degree radiation where did these early fluctuations seen in the CMB come from it's easy to point at a tree and explain that it grew from a seed but where did the seed come from [Music] imagine a box with nothing in it close the lid so no light can get in take all the air out with a pump and seal it cool it down to absolute zero insulate it with lead so no radiation can penetrate is it empty no the universe is a fundamentally noisy place there is no such thing as truly empty space even if there were no matter Inside the Box space is always permeated by Quantum Fields with different values at different positions one of these fields the Higgs field gives things Mass another the electromagnetic field gives things charge and Carries light one of the big discoveries of early modern physics by the likes of Heisenberg Einstein and Planck was the inherent noisiness of the universe there is uncertainty at the smallest scales which shows up as a faint buzz in the quantum fields at the quantum level even empty space is filled with Quantum Fields whose values are varying randomly but why is this important for the large-scale structure of the universe to answer that question we have to go back to the very start in the beginning the observable universe was hot dense and Tiny the also tiny Quantum fluctuations were buzzing along with very small differences in the roiling patchwork of energy Fields as they do today and then suddenly and dramatically inflation the universe rapidly expanded by 26 orders of magnitude in a tiny fraction of a second changes this extreme are hard to describe we don't have the words to properly conjure the scale of this explosion in our heads 26 orders of magnitude is a grain of sand one millimeter across expanding to a septillion meters across that's 100 million light years something on the scale of laniacaya and the violence of this detonation was staggering in 10 to the minus 33 seconds the observable universe went from microscopic to huge for all intents and purposes the expansion was instantaneous and so this inflation Amplified the quantum noise of the vacuum into genuine differences in density thus giving gravity all it needed to work its attractive Magic Gathering Mass together into Stars galaxies super clusters and filaments these variations would have been the first seeds inconceivably tiny Quantum fluctuations the forefathers of vast Intergalactic filaments many millions of light years in length tiny acorns growing into vast forests but that is not the end of the story [Music] after inflation was complete the universe continued to expand and cool down but it remained extremely hot and dense if the large-scale structure of the universe were purely shaped by the expansion of quantum fluctuations you would expect everything to be distributed fairly randomly indeed if you look at a population of galaxies and ask how far each Galaxy is from each other galaxy in the population you should see a simple relationship and regular clustering galaxies would tend to be fairly close together because of the clumping effect of gravity and so you should be thus and less likely to find two galaxies separated by larger distances and yet this is not what astronomers see when they do do this kind of analysis they observe one Peak for Galaxies that are close together as expected and another one for a separation of about 150 megaparsecs what explains this overabundance at what seems like an arbitrary distance the answer lies in what's known as baryon acoustic oscillations Galaxy dwarfing sound waves the hundreds of thousands of years after the big bang it was too hot for Atomic nuclei to capture electrons the universe was a sea of charged particles and photons of light couldn't travel in straight lines they would get bounced around scattering in every direction until they hit the next stray electron as it cooled some of the regions that were more dense would pull more and more stuff in but photons exert a pressure when they get too close together and this pressure would push out carrying some matter with it and this is where Dark Matter entered the picture Dark Matter outweighs regular matter in the universe by five times it was and Remains the dominant gravitational force in our universe the cosmic web of stars galaxies and filaments is really a web of dark matter with regular matter tagging along it accounts for something like 85 percent of the gravity in the universe so everything from Galaxy formation to Stark clustering and gravitational then Zing is dictated by its properties and yet we still don't know what it really is what we do know is that dark matter interacts gravitationally but doesn't seem to be affected by electromagnetism such as light or the other fundamental forces so as clumps of density began to form in the early Universe the photons would eventually get squeezed so much that they would burst out in a ferocious wave of plasma carrying some regular matter also known as baryons but leaving the Dark Matter behind in the center imagine a pebble dropped in a pool there is a central Splash and then concentric rings of ripples now imagine millions of Pebbles dropped at slightly different times it would create a complex jumble of splashes Ripples and regions where the Rings interacted this was the state of the universe after inflation but the universe was Cooling and once it reached 3000 Kelvin protons were able to capture electrons and the phase changed instead of a bubbling opaque plasma it became a transparent gas the moment the universe became transparent the cosmic microwave background radiation escaped and the expanding Rings suddenly stopped because the photons that were carrying the matter were no longer coupled with that matter the photons rushed off in a straight line leaving the ring Frozen at the distance it had reached and that distance is 150 megaparsecs exactly where we see the second bump in the graph of Galaxy separations this is one of the ways that cosmologists can see past the CMB by deciphering the patterns in its seemingly random distribution dark matter is Central to this story and indeed the structuring of the universe that followed in fact in a lot of ways dark matter is the true main character in The Narrative of the universe and yet they almost completely undetected until the mid-20th century back in 1933 a young and ambitious Swiss astronomer named Fritz Vicky noticed something odd about the speed of stars in a galaxy he observed the two independent measures of the mass of a cluster of galaxies weren't lining up if he counted up all the stars and added their Mass he got a number 10 times less than if he instead calculated the mass by looking at the speeds of the galaxies in the cluster he thus concluded that there must be an enormous amount of unseen Mass however it would be more than 30 years before further Evidence would come to light as pioneering astronomer Vera Rubin set her sights on spiral galaxies in predicting the Motions of stars around the center of galaxies astronomers had always made three assumptions one gravity depends on distance and mass the closer and more massive two objects are the stronger gravity acts on them 2. spiral galaxies have most of their stars in the very bright Central regions and three stars on the edge of galaxies would have less gravity acting on them and would travel more slowly this is analogous to our own solar system most of the mass is contained in the Sun so the close planets like Mercury Venus and Earth travel much faster than the gas giant Saturn Uranus and Neptune so imagine Vera rubin's surprise when she observed the speeds of stars in nearby spiral galaxies she found the relationship between speed and distance traced a straight line in her graph instead of acting like the solar system the stars on the edges of spiral galaxies traveled just as fast as those in their cause and so there was a fourth hidden assumption that astronomers were making which Reuben made explicit while it was true that spiral galaxies have most of their stars in the central regions Stars don't account for most of the mass in order to account for this increased speed normal matter Stars dust nebulae could only account for 15 of the total matter in the universe so what was this dark matter the leading theory currently is w-i-m-p's weekly interacting massive particles these would be Elementary particles like protons or neutrons but would have peculiar properties unlike protons which have a charge and interact with light these wimps would be invisible and only interact with gravity there would also need to be much heavier or much more numerous in order to make up for the missing mass in the universe today we know that all galaxies accept some dwarf Galaxies have larger Halos of Dark Matter surrounding them scientists estimate that the Milky Way's hay though could extend up to 15 times further than the matter we can see searches for these particles at particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland are giant Vats of noble gases in Antarctica and other places have so far come up without definitive proof for the wimp Theory but scientists are hopeful as dark matter explains so much about the large-scale structure of the universe it makes everything make sense The Echoes of baryonic shock waves the speeds of galaxies and the patterns of clustering in the growth of structure Across the Universe normal matter what we see and what we are is only really a bit player the main role in building the Universe goes to this mysterious invisible stuff foreign minuscule Quantum fluctuations to Galaxy dwarfing sound waves and finally vast tides of Dark Matter our webbed Universe was born problem solved not quite there are further structural Mysteries out there Mysteries we haven't even begun to unravel we are all moving in the same direction we're spinning on the earth which is revolving around the sun which is spiraling around the Galaxy which itself has motion but zooming much further out all the galaxies around us in laniacaya are pulled towards the same point in space we are all moving in the same direction but where are we going a scientist studied the CMB for the first time it became clear that our local group of galaxies was not stationary it was moving relative to the CMB in fact we are rushing at around 1 000 kilometers a second towards a point 250 million light years away and this point was dubbed the great attractor but what was there why this particular point and not somewhere else if according to the copernican principle no point in space is more special than any other why should so much mass move towards this this spot we didn't know then and we still aren't sure One Challenge was that whatever we were heading for was very hard to observe because we had to look through the center of our own Galaxy an area known as the zone of avoidance and one through which our view is obscured by Interstellar dust but we could see through it with x-rays and this method revealed a group of galaxies known as the Noma cluster but this alone wasn't enough to cover the flow of galaxies and so scientists watched the great attractor and came to a remarkable conclusion it is itself in motion towards a greater source of mass 650 million light years away lingered a vast supercluster the largest for a billion light years known as the shapley supercluster this Leviathan contains the mass of nearly 10 000 milky ways [Music] but that wasn't the end in 2017 researchers proposed a further element dubbed the dipole repeller it is a large void in almost the exact opposite direction to the shapley supercluster whereas sharply pulls this area of space doesn't literally repel but its under density means it can't overcome more powerful gravitational forces and we are sandwiched in the middle of this massive Stellar flow almost a billion light years across though this may seem unbeatably large this is only the beginning of the structural Oddities that appear in the large-scale mapping of the cosmos one long-standing mystery that came to light in the early 2000s was related to the assumed homogeneity of our universe the issue is fairly simple if you divide the sphere of the CMB into four or eight the top right is on average hotter than the bottom left this effect disappears if you divide the sky into more and more pieces but for the quadrupole and the octopole the angle of the line between the hot part and the cold part matches almost exactly with the plane of our solar system this is a result so odd that astronomers have named it the axis of Evil because it threatens to break our most fundamental ideas about the universe why would the background of the universe be aligned with our solar system we don't know nobody does the chief scientist of the wmap telescope Charles Bennett thinks it must be a coincidence I do think that there is a bit of a psychological effect people want to find unusual things but even with new data from the Planck telescope the effect is reproduced in the words of Dominic Schwartz from the University of bietherfeld in Germany for a long time part of the community was hoping that this would go away but it hasn't it is still totally unexplained we understand so much about our physical world we can shoot satellites into the sky to take baby pictures of the universe and use these images to rewind the cosmos back to its first moments between general relativity and the standard model of particle physics we think we have it all figured out but there is much we do not know of course in order to have structure in the universe first the universe must begin so how did we get our start what's set off inflation the answer to this question may be hidden in the patterns of the universe's largest structures one idea is that in the primordial Universe there is a roiling sea of dense vacuum energy and it just takes something to set off an inflationary bubble which then grows into a universe but there's nothing saying ours was the only inflationary bubble perhaps another Universe formed nearby just on the other side of the CMB and if it went through inflation it might collide with us so this is one big mystery that the CMB May yet hold the answer to great spots in the sky resulting from collisions with other bubble universes we haven't seen anything yet but even the possibility of evidence for Multiverse theories is so sparse that merely a method to find a glimmer of proof is enough to excite scientists [Music] where are you the observable universe lania Kea Virgo supercluster local group Milky Way Orion arm local cavity local Interstellar Cloud odd Cloud solar system earth at every scale there is structure there is order this structure is governed by simple principles gravity which is dominated by dark matter and expansion which is now driven by dark energy but which at one stage was the result of inflation and yet these basic principles turn matter and energy into huge beautiful structures bathed in the warm glow of the cosmic microwave background radiation Copernicus shapley's Vicky Rubin zeldovich Peebles got all of these scientists and the teams that supported them have brought us this far in uncovering its secrets and yet despite all that we know there are still Mysteries out there Written in the Stars
